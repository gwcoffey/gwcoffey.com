<p>Let me start by saying: ‚ÄúOuch.‚Äù It has been far, far, far too long since our last article. Someone much wiser than me once said something like this: ‚ÄúMy only comfort is that I tried. My only regret is that I failed.‚Äù I‚Äôll leave it at that.</p>
<p>In short order, I‚Äôll be posting our first new article in over 18 months. But first I thought I‚Äôd share a little news. For those who are here for great FileMaker info, feel free to skip ahead. (And let‚Äôs be honest, that‚Äôs the only reason <em>any</em> of you are here.)</p>
<p>As many of you have noticed, my name is not on the cover of <em>FileMaker Pro 11: The Missing Manual</em>. Since I know a lot of people will ask, here‚Äôs the scoop:</p>
<p>I love O‚ÄôReilly and we had (have?) a fantastic relationship. I still remember the first O‚ÄôReilly book I ever read (The Camel Book), and the awe I felt at its immense quality. It was absolutely an honor to work with a company whose product I respect so much.</p>
<p>It should go without saying, but I love my former co-author, Susan Prosser, who has been a professional associate and personal friend for years. I loved working on the book. The process was hectic, and aggravating, and fun, and wonderful in a million ways.</p>
<p>But writing a book is a labor of love. If you add up all the late nights and killer deadlines and huge work, and divide by the modest revenues, it‚Äôs a tough sell. I always considered it worth it because (here comes the honesty) it helped my reputation, helped me sell my services, and was a bit of a thrill. But the calculus has shifted a little. I don‚Äôt know how much the book does those things anymore. So when it came time to fire up Microsoft Word (barf) and start in on a revision for 11, I realized I couldn‚Äôt justify the stress and life-disruption this time around. This was a personal decision on my part.</p>
<p>In the beginning, I wrote the never-publised <em>FileMaker Pro 7, The Missing Manual</em> over months of long nights. Susan later saved my bacon by revising my manuscript for FileMaker 8 so it could see the light of day. I then had the opportunity to work on revisions for 9 and 10 with Susan. In all, we wrote or revised approaching 3,000 pages, over a thousand screen shots and figures, and a dozen screen casts.</p>
<p>After all that, I would be remiss if I didn‚Äôt say this: <em>Thank you</em>.</p>
<p>Thank you to <strong>Vince Menanno</strong> who convinced me to pursue the project in the first place. Thank you to <strong>Tim O‚ÄôReilly</strong> who blew my mind when he responded personally to the inquiry placed on the O‚ÄôReilly web side. Thank you to <strong>Susan Prosser</strong> who literally saved the book from failure, and made later revisions a joy. Thank you to <strong>Stuart Gripman</strong> of Crooked Arm Consulting who ably picked up the reins for FileMaker 11. Thank you to my first editor, <strong>David Pogue</strong>‚ÄîI will never forget the validation I felt as an aspiring writer when he encouraged me along. Thank you to <strong>Nan Barber</strong>, my editor, who made the book much better than it otherwise could have been. Thank you to my wife <strong>Mamie</strong> and my children, <strong>Isabel</strong> and <strong>Sophia</strong>, who surrendered a husband and father to the computer for a few months every couple of years. And thank you to everyone who read the book, which may include <strong>you</strong>. (Especially those of you who left positive feedback on Amazon.com üòâ).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m full of mixed emotions right now. On the one hand it is a relief to watch a new FileMaker release roll out and not be on a deadline. On the other hand, it&rsquo;s a little sad. In some ways I miss the crunch, and especially the deep-dive into the minutia of a new release.</p>
<p>Ok, I‚Äôm done with all that now. Back to regularly scheduled (Ha!) programming.</p>
<p>Geoff</p>
