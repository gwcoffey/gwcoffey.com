<p>There comes a time in every FileMaker developer’s life when they need to export a file <em>temporarily</em>. Maybe you’re exporting records only to import them right back in again later. Or perhaps your creating a PDF file that you <em>only</em> want to email to someone.</p>
<p>And with this need comes an eternal question: Where should you <em>put</em> it?</p>
<p>Finally, in FileMaker 9, we have an answer.</p>
<p>In fact, every modern operating system provides a perfect place for this sort of thing: The so-called “temp folder.” This special folder has a few powers that make it an ideal candidate:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is always there, so you never have to worry that your user might not have one.</li>
<li>A user on the computer can <em>always</em> write to his temp folder. There’s no need to stress about permissions problems. Also, the temp folder <em>can’t</em> be seen by any other user, so it’s secure.</li>
<li>Best of all, files in the temp folder are automatically deleted whenever the computer restarts.</li>
</ol>
<p>The temp folder is nothing new. It’s been right there on your Windows or Mac OS X computer from the very beginning. But it isn’t always in the same place, and it can be tough to find inside a FileMaker script.</p>
<p>FileMaker 9 works around this problem with a new calculation function: <code>Get(TemporaryPath)</code>. This function figures out where the best temp folder is on the computer FileMaker’s running on and returns its path, ready to use in a variable-based export.</p>
<p>Here’s an example. Normally, you can’t “open” a file stored in a container field. FileMaker only lets you open the file directly if you’ve stored a <em>reference</em> to the file in the container. Here’s a script that works around this limitation. It exports the file to the temp folder, then imports a reference to it into a global. Finally, it tells FileMaker to open the temporary file.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Set Variable [ $path; Get(TemporaryPath) &amp; “my_temporary_file.jpg” ]
Export Field Content [ My Container Field; $path ]
Insert File [ Reference; My Global Container, $path ]
Go to Field [ Select/perform; My Global Container ]
</code></pre>
