      <description>[ed: Sophie was asking me about how Google works and when I explained it to her she asked if we could make it so you could search for &amp;ldquo;sister diving into a nostril&amp;rdquo; and find something. I said yes and this post was born.]

      <title>An Actual Conversation with Siri</title>
      <link>http://gwcoffey.com/archive/posterous/an-actual-conversation-with-siri/</link>

      <description>I use Siri to text my wife when I leave work to let her know I&amp;rsquo;m on my way. It is super handy and saves me about 15 seconds every day, which appeals to my inner lazy. Unfortunately, although Siri is very good, she&amp;rsquo;s by no means human. I occasionally throw her off by being too informal. The other day this conversation took place:
ME: Siri, text my wife and tell her I&amp;rsquo;m on my way home now.</description>

      <description>Sophie and her friend Allison ran a fund raiser for the humane society this summer. They put on a &amp;ldquo;dog show&amp;rdquo; with the neighborhood dogs, complete with games, prizes, and homemade treats. Their goal was &amp;ldquo;101 donations&amp;rdquo; (aka, $101), which they handily beat.
They were then invited to participate in the Arizona Humane Society Telethon as &amp;ldquo;Youth Ambassadors.&amp;rdquo; They had a blast!

      <description>You almost can&amp;rsquo;t install a piece of open source software without invoking the tar command. Inevitably, the installation instructions include a command line like the one below. Use this handy guide to fully understand what each part of this powerful command really means.

      <description>I bought a Makey Makey for my girls and I to play with. At one point, the girls wired up a series of aluminum-foil-based touch pads taped to the floor. Each pad was connected to a different input (with a different colored wire). I wrote a little HTML page that responded to the input by showing/hiding matching colored bars.
When we first set it up we had the blue-wired touchpad mixed up with the green one.</description>

      <title>This is What I Think Every Time I See Time Travel in Movies</title>
      <link>http://gwcoffey.com/archive/posterous/this-is-what-i-think-every-time-i-see-time-travel-in-movies/</link>

      <description>Same place, different time.
A lot happens in one minute. The Earth moves about 11,000 km in its path around the sun. Meanwhile, the sun (and all the rest of the solar system) moves about 13,000 km in its path around the center of the galaxy. Note that the Earth itself is about 13,000 km in diameter.
The whole Milky Way galaxy also &amp;ldquo;moves&amp;rdquo; in the direction of the constellation Leo, but this is due to the expansion of the universe itself, so it would be fair to say that any &amp;ldquo;same place&amp;rdquo; in the universe also moves with it, making this movement irrelevant.</description>

      <title>Anton Ego’s Piece at the End of Ratatouille</title>

      <description>This is legitimately great (emphasis mine):
In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face is that, in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is more meaningful than our criticism designating it so.</description>

      <description>Well, call me stupid, but I set up some periodic database backups using ZIP. Unfortunately, the normal (non-64-bit) ZIP file format can&amp;rsquo;t handle input files over 4GB (even if the output ZIP file is much smaller).
The Problem My cron jobs began failing when one of my databases grew over 4GB, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice because ZIP files were still being created on schedule. Alas they were truncated files that couldn&amp;rsquo;t actually be unzipped.</description>

This is not a parable
This is a terrible…

Yes I will rhyme that after…

      <description>You asked for it. This is my off-the-cuff list. I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll think of other things.
Code Editing Coda has an annoying habit of treating &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; as angle brackets in ruby files when you have &amp;ldquo;Automatically close brackets&amp;rdquo; turned on.
Code handles &amp;lt; in Javascript cleanly.
But…
But in Ruby code it gets confused.
Note that there are no angle brackets in ruby, so there&amp;rsquo;s no need to auto-close them in .</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m not sure making the world a worse place for everyone just because some loser didn&amp;rsquo;t pay for Windows is a good idea&amp;hellip; This is like a law that if someone steals they are no longer allowed to get vaccinations. Only in this alternate world, 80% of people steal, and so disease runs rampant.
I mean I feel Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s pain here. They experience more software theft than anyone else by a long shot.</description>

A few years ago I was working on site with a client in Tempe. I had use of a private office and a keyboard, mouse, and screen to which I could attach my laptop. But I prefer the laptop mouse and keyboard in most cases, so I would connect only the screen, as a secondary display, to make use of on occasion.</description>

Teenagers Teenagers really aren’t so bad
You still have plenty of hugs for dad
You still laugh out loud
You still hold my hand
You still make me proud
Still play in the sand
The only real difference
I now realize
Is you’re one year older
And you now roll your eyes</description>

      <description>Mac OS X Lion does iPhone-style autocorrect as you type. I&amp;rsquo;m leaving it on for now to see if I like it. If it autocorrects something, you can press Escape to ignore the correction, but sometimes I&amp;rsquo;m typing and not paying attention, and a correction I don&amp;rsquo;t want is applied. Like on the iPhone, you can back up to the word that was corrected and it will show a popup like the one below so you can quickly restore what you originally entered:</description>

Here it is with some data points:

Note, for instance, that Exxon is doing it wrong. They only need to be a little more evil to appear completely good. Google, on the other hand, totally has it figured out.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s been some grumbling recently about OAuth and the Twitter API. Gruber posits that this is a bad thing dressed up to look like a good thing. But really, it is a good thing.
The whole point of OAuth is to allow me to authorize one service (like Flickr, Posterous, FourSquare, Instagram, or, yes, even a full Twitter client) to interact with another service (like Twitter) on my behalf without giving them my password.</description>

Guinea Pig, O’ Guinea Pig
I have bad news for thee Tho’ your name is Guinea Pig
You are no pig to me
For pigs are big, and round, and snort
And dig all day in dirt
But all you ever seem to do
Is pee upon my shirt

Go Daddy will try very hard from now on to “up sell” you with additional names and services. You do not need to purchase other related names (and there is no benefit to you to do so unless you’re trying to protect a recognized brand) so avoid the extra check boxes. As you proceed, look for the “No Thanks” buttons, which will bypass all the unnecessary add-ons.</description>

      <description>I grew up on the cul-de-sac end of a long suburban street. The neighborhood this street was part of backed up to a small strip of young but wild wood about a quarter mile wide, and this, beginning with a long downward slope, formed the barrier between our back yard and the farm fields and county roads beyond. My brother and I spent long afternoons in what we called “the ravine,” climbing trees, chasing squirrels, and generally reveling in a place protected from parental view.</description>

Billy had a framed prayer on his office wall which expressed his method for keeping going, even though he was unenthusiastic about living. A lot of patients who saw the prayer on Billy’s wall told him that it helped them to keep going, too.</description>

Submit?
So far as I know, the word &amp;ldquo;submit&amp;rdquo; only has two meanings. Since I haven&amp;rsquo;t even started my application, I&amp;rsquo;m clearly not presenting an application to a body for consideration. The only other meaning of &amp;ldquo;submit&amp;rdquo; is to yield to a superior force, so…

      <description>I love the novel Stoner by John Williams. [ed: Since this was written I&amp;rsquo;ve read Williams&amp;rsquo; Augustus twice and it has become one of my favorite novels.] One thing I appreciated is the way Williams writes about Stoner&amp;rsquo;s awareness of his physical self, especially his hands.
For example here where it seems to symbolize Stoner&amp;rsquo;s anxiety:
Stoner wet his lips and shifted on the chair. He tried to fold his large hands together so that they would be invisible.</description>

      <description>For reasons I don&amp;rsquo;t fully understand, using ActiveRecord in Rails 2.3 (or at least 2.3.11) with the MySQL gem version 2.8.1 on Mac OS X 10.6 (or at least 10.6.7) produces this error. With other versions of Rails, you may get a different error, but the underlying cause is the same. The internet is rife with suggestions that may or may not be helpful with various version combinations. But none of them helped in my case.</description>

      <description>Matt asked if there was a way to show askew text on a FileMaker layout. (Rotated something other than 90°.) You can&amp;rsquo;t do this directly with the text object, but you can get the same effect using a web view with HTML + CSS.
Here&amp;rsquo;s an example HTML snippet:
&amp;lt;html&amp;gt; &amp;lt;body&amp;gt; &amp;lt;h1 style=&amp;#34;font-family: Georgia; font-size: 20px; -webkit-transform: rotate(-3deg);&amp;#34;&amp;gt; Matt Petrowsky &amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/html&amp;gt; To embed this in a web view, use a data url (which can be the result of a calculation):</description>

I know angle A, distance D, angle AΔ and distance DΔ. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to find angle A?. This is what I came up with:
The proposed formula.
At first I thought I was all good, but this doesn&amp;rsquo;t work for all A and AΔ (which is obvious in hindsight). For instance, this works fine if A is negative:

Whereas incessant honking outside my window induces unhealthy rage which is potentially harmful to the people of these United States, the following shall take effect immediately:
If any vehicle is sold in the United States with the capacity to honk repeatedly against the wishes of its operator, the CEO of the vehicle manufacturer shall be subjected to 300 consecutive hours, in a standing position, of a loud looping recording of Sara Palin being sassy.</description>

The association itself is neat because it seems crazy to me that nobody noticed this before. But I have to put on my old-mac-user-pedant hat for a second.The article says:
But did the concept for this graphic originate in Cupertino in the 1980s, or much earlier on another continent? The blue Mac OS logo definitely did not originate in the 1980s. I remember clearly when this logo was introduced, first in the press and then in the Mac OS startup splash screen.</description>

JK Rowling:
I love the book Harry Potter. They are my favorite books in the world. The books are way better than the movies.
I did a report on you in school. I learned what JK stands for. It stands for Joanne Kathleen. I learned other stuff too. I want to meet you Miss Rowling.</description>

      <description>I do this thing where I ask non-native-English speakers who is the &amp;ldquo;Shakespeare&amp;rdquo; of their language. They can interpret this any way they want, and it is a great source of new things for me to read. When I asked my friend Ines—who is German—this question, she suggested Stefan Zweig on the grounds that he is someone every school-aged German reads.
To my surprise, Ines gave me a collection of Zweig&amp;rsquo;s short stories over Thanksgiving.</description>

      <description>The latest issue of Cook&amp;rsquo;s Illustrated included this recipe for banana bread that squeezes six bananas in one loaf. To manage moisture they extract liquid from five of them (by cooking and straining), then reduce that liquid and put it back in the batter. (The final banana is sliced for a decorative top).
This bread was great. Really intense flavor, moise-but-not-too, nice crisp edges.

      <description>I was trying to do a rails deployment on a Mac OS X Server 10.5 machine tonight and hit a gem error I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen before:
sh-3.2# gem install [whatever] ERROR: While executing gem ... (Gem::RemoteSourceException) HTTP Response 302 fetching http://gems.rubyforge.org/yaml No problem, says I.
Just need a quick gem system update:
sh-3.2# gem update --system ERROR: While executing gem ... (Gem::RemoteSourceException) HTTP Response 302 fetching http://gems.rubyforge.org/yaml Blast.
Google was no help.</description>

      <description>Int. Apple Store, in alternate universe where the iPhone 4 is available in two models with two antenna designs.
SALES REP: &amp;ldquo;Welcome to the Apple Store. Do you need any help today?&amp;rdquo;
CUSTOMER 1: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of getting the iPhone 4.&amp;rdquo;
SALES REP: &amp;ldquo;Awesome, let me show them to you. This is Model A. As you can see, it is exceptionally thin and beautifully constructed. Here, try it out.&amp;rdquo;

      <title>A System of Classification for Children&#39;s Literature</title>

      <guid>http://gwcoffey.com/archive/posterous/a-system-of-classification-for-childrens-literature/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve come to the realization that all children’s literature can be classified quite neatly into just a few simple categories. My proposed system of classification follows.
Type 1: The Outcast Hero An adolescent human, or sometimes anthropomorphized animal or (rarely) toaster who is an outcast in their family, community, or peer group discovers, through an unexpected adventure, something fantastic about him- or herself or the world, often providing aid to others in the process.</description>

      <description>Sandra Day O&amp;rsquo;Connor read this poem during her retirement speech. I got a kick out of it.
There is No Indispensable Man Sometime when you&#39;re feeling important
Sometime when your ego&#39;s in bloom
Sometime when you take it for granted
You&#39;re the best qualified in the room
Sometime when you feel that your going
Would leave an unfillable hole
Just follow these simple instructions
And see how they humble your soul</description>

      <title>I Need a New Laptop Bag</title>

      <description>My 8-year-old laptop backpack finally met its end last week, so I&amp;rsquo;m looking for a new one. I prefer a backpack style since I walk a lot with my laptop. I also really like the kind with a single across-the-chest strap because I find it hard to get both my ape-like arms out of a normal backpack without hurting my shoulders.
Vince has a great SwissGear backpack that I&amp;rsquo;ve always admired.</description>

      <description>…and the last word is misspelled and iPhone offers a correction and I just touch “Send” without accepting the correction in any way, will the word be corrected before the email is sent?
I just tried it and the answer is: yes.</description>

      <description>Kathleen Sheeder Bonanno is new to me. I heard her interviewed on Diane Rehm today. I just ordered her book, Slamming Open the Door.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m reading Shantaram by Gregory David Roberts on the recommendation of my dad. Still working on the book but I do really like the opening lines:
It took me a long time and most of the world to learn what I know about love and fate and the choices we make, but the heart of it came to me in an instant, while I was chained to a wall and being tortured.</description>
