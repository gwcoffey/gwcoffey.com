<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;m accused of being a good person, and I have to remind people that it <em>being evil</em> and <em>appearing evil</em> are only positively correlated for sufficiently small values of evil.</p>
<figure><img src="image-1.png"
         alt="A graph showing a line progressing from less evil to more evil. The height of the line represents the appearance of evil. The line rises steadily until the half-way point. It then falls quickly." width="569" height="382"/><figcaption>
            <p>The deceoption inflection.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here it is with some data points:</p>
<figure><img src="image-2.png"
         alt="The same graph with some points labeled. Mid-way across and high on the appeaance of evil sits Apple. On the other side of the peak, Exxon. Google is all the way to the right." width="569" height="407"/><figcaption>
            <p>Evil corporations.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Note, for instance, that Exxon is doing it wrong. They only need to be a little more evil to appear completely good. Google, on the other hand, totally has it figured out. Be <em>exceptionally</em> evil, and then actually declare that you are not evil. People believe that kind of crap. Apple, love &rsquo;em or hate &rsquo;em, is completely upfront about its evilness, which means, by definition, it isn&rsquo;t all that evil really.</p>
