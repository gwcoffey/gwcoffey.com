<p>I love the novel <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoner_(novel)">Stoner</a></em> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Edward_Williams">John Williams</a>. [<em>ed:</em> Since this was written I&rsquo;ve read Williams&rsquo; <em>Augustus</em> twice and it has become one of my favorite novels.] One thing I appreciated is the way Williams writes about Stoner&rsquo;s awareness of his physical self, especially his hands.</p>
<p>For example here where it seems to symbolize Stoner&rsquo;s anxiety:</p>
<blockquote>
Stoner wet his lips and shifted on the chair. He tried to fold his large hands together so that they would be invisible.
<cite>Kindle Location 402.</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>And here where it shows us something about his curiosity:</p>
<blockquote>
Stoner became aware that his fingers were unclenching their hard grip on his desk-top. He turned his hands about under his gaze, marveling at their brownness, at the intricate way the nails fit into his blunt finger-ends; he thought he could feel the blood flowing invisibly through the tiny veins and arteries, throbbing delicately and precariously from his fingertips through his body.
<cite>Kindle Location 326</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>There are several passages like this, revealing Stoner&rsquo;s interior self through his observation of his exterior self. Good stuff.</p>
