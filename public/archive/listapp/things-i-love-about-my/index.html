   			<p class="item">It is a block from my house.</p><p class="desc">When I was a little boy and I visited my grandparents in small-town northern Indiana, my grandpa would always put on his seersucker pants and boater and walk to the barber with my brother and I. We&#39;d all get our hair cut together. My mom even bought us our own &#34;grandpa pants&#34; to wear to this outing once. Now I walk to my barber too!</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">It&#39;s so stereotypically Russian it makes me smile.</p><p class="desc">Barbers include Roman, Boris, Ibragim, Oksana, and Sasha. Oksana stands out as a pretty young blond woman working with 4 older men.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">I never make an appointment.</p><p class="desc">I just wake up and think &#34;time for a cut&#34; and then walk down there early and almost always sit right down.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Each barber has a distinctive style.</p><p class="desc">Oksana is fast and intricate with scissors and fingers. Roman is a scissors/comb/fingers guy, slower and calmer. Ibragim uses a comb and a straight razor. And Boris uses an electric razor with guard and finishes with a funny scissors/comb/scissors maneuver  Boris also never uses water.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">They clean up the edges with a straight razor and hot shaving cream.</p><p class="desc">It all feels so precise and perfected when they tidy up your sideburns, around the ears, and the back of the neck with a straight razor. And that piping hot shaving cream is a great touch.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">They trim my eyebrows.</p><p class="desc">This makes my wife so happy. Also my nose and occasionally my ears. See my previous list about being old now.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Back and shoulder massage.</p><p class="desc">After the cut I get tidied up with a steaming hot towel, then wrapped, and then a back and shoulder massage. Best of all they use electric massagers: No scary human contact. Sometimes I get a scalp massage too.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">They have great clientele.</p><p class="desc">Today a grandpa and a papa were there with this adorable grand daughter. She watched fascinated while they got their hair cut side by side. It was her birthday and she was wearing a cupcake birthday hat with pride. When Roman wrapped grandpa&#39;s head with a hot towel he sculpted it to look like a fox which made her laugh and laugh. Then later she said &#34;Grandpa you look like a lovely lady!&#34;</p></div></div>
