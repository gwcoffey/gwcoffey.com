<p>Inspired by my feed right now. I limited this to fiction but I read mostly non-fiction as a kid.</p>
<ul class="listapp">

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">The Giving Tree</p><p class="desc">Controversial I know. First, to heck with your controversy because this was my first biggest favorite thing way before I was aware enough to discern any problematic interpretation. I loved this book more than anything in the world from before I can remember. And second, to heck with your controversy because this book is lovely.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Alexander and the No Good Terrible Horrible Very Bad Day</p><p class="desc">Another of my early favorites.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Charlotte&#39;s Web</p><p class="desc">My mother read it to me. My teacher read it to us. I read it myself. I read it to both my children separately. And I&#39;ve read it myself in adulthood a few times. If you forced me to pick a favorite book I would refuse. But if you found a way to persuade me I&#39;d pick this book.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">The Oz Books</p><p class="desc">My mom read us the whole series over a couple of summers and I was mesmerized.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland</p><p class="desc">Mom read this one just to me when my brother was off reading his own books. It is such an amazing book even today.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Ramona Quimby</p><p class="desc">Some of the first books I read and loved myself. When I read them to my kids years later I discovered they are even more beautiful than I remembered.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</p><p class="desc">And many other Roald Dahl books. I loved the spectacular Quentin Blake illustrations as much as the stories.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</p><p class="desc">The first very grown up book I remember reading. Can hardly remember the story but I felt very mature.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">And then I discovered Vonnegut and that&#39;s pretty much all I read until I was through high school.</p></div></div>
   </li>

</ul>
