<p>I&rsquo;m a little anti-social which might factor in to these. Please note: there&rsquo;s no judgement here. I&rsquo;m not suggesting these things are unworthy of time. I have great respect for our culture. I just don&rsquo;t understand it sometimes or don&rsquo;t feel a compulsion to engage. I&rsquo;m not sure why.</p>

   			<p class="item">I&#39;ve only watched one television show for its entire run in my life.</p><p class="desc">I&#39;ve watched bits and pieces of lots of shows of course, but never had a show I really watched except Buffy. Simpsons is maybe a second but I&#39;ve probably only seen 1/10th of it.</p></div></div>

   			<p class="item">I&#39;ve never seen a Godfather movie.</p><p class="desc">I tell myself constantly that I should watch them but I never do. I&#39;ve never seen a lot of movies that are apparently really good.</p></div></div>

   			<p class="item">I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever read a fiction book while it was hot except when reading children&#39;s lit to my kids. And I rarely read fiction that isn&#39;t 20&#43; years old.</p><p class="desc">Sometimes I think it&#39;s neat that people participate in this global conversation about the thing of now but i never prioritize it enough to participate. I&#39;m always late to the party. And there&#39;s so much to read...</p></div></div>

   			<p class="item">I never know who anyone is when people are talking about people who are apparently somebody.</p><p class="desc">I always have to google names of apparently famous people. Half because I&#39;m terrible with names and half because I&#39;m out of the loop. I also got the Foo Fighters and the Goo Goo Dolls mixed up for a few days once because I was confused about Dave Grohl. It was a little embarrassing.</p></div></div>

   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">I&#39;ve never seen a reality tv show.</p><p class="desc">I saw parts of an episode of Survivor once. My old business partner&#39;s girl friend used to watch some show where Gordon Ramsey revamps restaurants while yelling at the owners and it would be on in the background while I worked sometimes. And my daughter watches a show about elaborate cakes which I&#39;ve seen parts of.  I don&#39;t like when people are mean to each other. So I struggle with these.</p></div></div>

   			<p class="item">The last Hip Hop/&#34;rap&#34; music I listened to was Public Enemy on the early 90s.</p><p class="desc">But I&#39;ve of course heard more recent stuff now and again.</p></div></div>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">I watched Super Bowl 20 and Super Bowl 40.</p><p class="desc">Plus three high school football games and one Indiana University football game. These make up the sum total of football I&#39;ve seen in my life. I did watch a lot of college basketball in my teens. And I&#39;ve been to a few baseball games and one pro basketball game.</p></div></div>

   			<p class="item">I have not materially changed my style of clothing since high school.</p><p class="desc">Blue jeans. Brown leather shoes. Plaid short sleeve button up shirts. These are the things that will get you through.</p></div></div>

   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">I never watch R-rated comedies</p><p class="desc">This one is judgmental: I always hate them. There are lots of good dramas and fantasies etc. But raunchy or juvenile comedy does exactly nothing for me. The last one I saw was Bridesmaids which I did not like much. Side note: I adore Kristin Wiig.</p></div></div>

   			<p class="item">I have been to exactly one rock concert since 1994.</p><p class="desc">Went with my wife to U2 a few years ago. I have always said I don&#39;t really understand watching music. I get so bored.</p></div></div>
