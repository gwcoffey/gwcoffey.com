<p>As you know, marriage was undermined last week. Here&rsquo;s my diary of the aftermath in this lonely post-marriage outpost. I hope there&rsquo;s somebody left to read this.</p>
<ol class="listapp">

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Day 1: The beginning of the end</p><p class="desc">Surprisingly my marriage is still intact. But my wife is traveling with spotty cell service so it is possible she hasn&#39;t been able to get through to me to call it off.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Day 2: Churching</p><p class="desc">Went to church today. Bishop reminded us that people supporting gay marriage are ok. Drove to the hospital to visit a guy with a toe problem and the guy I went with said it was a shame about the gays. But he&#39;s kind of an idiot so I just let it go. All the married people seem to still be married.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Day 3: Back to work</p><p class="desc">Went to work today. I work for Apple which is like the biggest gay company in the world. The CEO is gay. Like 40% of my coworkers are gay. Their logo even used to be a gay rainbow back before it was cool. So it will come as no surprise that the apocalyptic influence of gay marriage has had no discernible negative impact on my job.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Day 4: Cracks in the fabric of society are beginning to appear</p><p class="desc">Found out from a neighbor today that the other neighbors are getting a divorce. IT IS UPON US. Actually they were apparently planning this months ago but I&#39;m sure that was caused by gay marriage premonitions or something. I&#39;m very scared.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Day 5: Together again</p><p class="desc">Never mind. I was wrong about my neighbors. They&#39;re not getting a divorce. They&#39;re just moving. We live in a pretty gay neighborhood though so it might be related. Side note: Never trust Phil for news. I think he might be one of them. Stupid Phil.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Day 6: Reunited and it feels so doomed</p><p class="desc">My wife got home from her trip today. Looks like so far we&#39;re still married, but I can feel the sanctity being sucked out of our relationship as I write this.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Day 7: Nothing to report</p><p class="desc">I&#39;m beginning to think the institution of marriage might survive this. It may just be Friday talking though. TGIF.</p></div></div>
   </li>
