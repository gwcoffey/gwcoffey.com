<p>This is an ill-formed set of primordial thoughts demanding deeper understanding on my part. Stuff I&rsquo;ve been thinking about a lot.</p>
<ul class="listapp">

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Assumption #1: We elect presidents and making that selection should be democratic.</p><p class="desc">(It isn&#39;t terribly democratic right now given our electoral system and I&#39;m still on the fence about pros/cons of that but that&#39;s a different list.)</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Assumption #2: We don&#39;t elect candidates. Anybody can run for president if they meet the constitutional requirements. There&#39;s no obvious constitutional right to democratically select who runs.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Assumption #3: The Republican primary system is overall a little more &#34;democratic&#34; than the Democrats&#39;.</p><p class="desc">Fewer caucuses, no super delegates, more winner take all which favors popular favorites over underdogs.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Assumption #4: The republican primaries have promoted poor candidates for several cycles and this year actually selected an unqualified bad candidate.</p><p class="desc">The party ticket is topped by a non-republican who&#39;s positions don&#39;t align well with the party, who the party doesn&#39;t want, and who is an embarrassment to the party.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Contentious Assumption #5: Bernie Sanders was a strong second in the Democratic primary as an outsider who arguably would be bad for the party.</p><p class="desc">I like a lot about Bernie but he definitely isn&#39;t an insider the party can trust to fall in line to further its interests nation-wide over the long run and up and down the ticket.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Contentious Assumption #6: The major parties serve an important role organizing voters, defining packaged platforms, running grassroots campaigns, fostering candidates at every level, and bringing organization and funding infrastructure to the whole process.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Contentious Assumption #7: Our non-parliamentary executive branch is designed in such a way that a multi-party system would be dangerous. The two party system is the only thing potentially stopping a Trump presidency. And a president elected with 10% of the popular vote has the same exact constitutional power as one elected with 90% of the vote</p><p class="desc">I used to be a big &#34;third parties!&#34; person but on reflection, I think it&#39;s a terrible idea. And ultimately I think any party would anger any person in some ways any time it has broad appeal. Only highly factional divisive parties can appeal to all their supporters in every way.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">[Correction: Of course a heavily divided multiparty election would be unlikely to award a majority of electoral votes to any candidate in which case the House of Representatives would choose the winner. You can&#39;t win the presidency with 10% of the popular vote. I had forgotten this when I wrote the above.]</p><p class="desc">But the point still stands: not a system well suited to multiple parties.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Background: Historically the parties chose their own candidates as they saw fit. This resulted in instances of insider corruption. The current democratization of the primary process is a result of the McGovern-Fraser Commission of 1972.</p><p class="desc">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGovernâ€“Fraser_Commission</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Concession #1: It isn&#39;t really a fair characterization to say the parties are &#34;private organizations&#34; and leave it at that. Given our strong two party system, it is reasonable to at least consider a regulatory infrastructure that encourages transparency in the nominating process.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Contentious Concession #2: The undemocratic structure of the Democratic primary system actually helped Sanders more than it hurt him. Delegate splitting and caucuses both worked to his advantage.</p><p class="desc">If it had been more &#34;democratic&#34; he would have been out much earlier. Undemocratic caucuses heavily favored Sanders and delegate splitting in general favors the second place candidate because of rounding.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Question #1: What is the justification for open primaries?</p><p class="desc">Full disclosure: I&#39;m not a member of any political party. Recently (last 4-6 years maybe) I&#39;ve begun to consider joining a party and being involved in it locally. I&#39;m now pretty sure I will. But as an outsider, I have always refrained from voting in the primaries on philosophical grounds. I&#39;m not a participating party member so why should I have a say in who the party runs? I get my say in the election.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Question #2: Does a more democratic primary process undermine the ability for the parties to run effective high quality candidates?</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Question #3: Historiclly, what kinds of corruption lead to the McGovern-Fraser Commission and did the reformed system fix those problems?</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Question #4: Does the reformed system directly lead to or contribute to promoting lower quality candidates?</p><p class="desc">At all levels, not just just for president. I personally believe Clinton is extremely qualified.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Question #5: How much role should the national party, with an eye toward the efficacy of the whole organization, have in promoting its candidates of choice?</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">This is not meant to be a contentious list. I&#39;m not sure of the answers to any of these.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">I wonder out loud if we might have gone too far. I wonder if the party establishment shouldn&#39;t openly have a bigger role in promoting its candidates. I wonder if open primaries should be closed so parties can run their own nominating elections. I wonder if last minute party switching to make a primary deadline should be stopped.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">But mostly I wonder how Trump ended up at the top of one of the two &#34;major&#34; parties instead of off in a corner saying stupid stuff to an extremist crowd like Jill Stein.</p><p class="desc">(Ok that part was meant to be a little contentious. ðŸ˜¶)</p></div></div>
