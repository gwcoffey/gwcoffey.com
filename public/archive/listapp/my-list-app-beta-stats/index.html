<p>I was on The List App beta for 20 weeks. Invited by @ChrisK. For whatever reason I never invited anyone. This was a natural outlet for me because I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of keeping lists of semi-random things.</p>
<ul class="listapp">

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">In that time I made 160 lists, received 2,129 likes, 326 shares, 688 comments, and 37 suggestions. My average list has 9 items, one has 70 and thee have just one.</p></div></div>

Shaun wasn&#39;t here back then so I linked up some of my favorites from his site in four lists (which of course I had long kept privately). Search for &#34;a list of letters&#34; to find them all.</p></div></div>

   			<p class="item">My least popular list: a tie between THINGS LUCINDA WILLIAMS WAS BLESSED BY and ICONIC U2 GUITAR HOOKS</p><p class="desc">Just one like each. https://li.st/l/31383434-3739-0000-0000-000000000000 and https://li.st/l/31383235-3937-0000-0000-000000000000</p></div></div>

   			<p class="item">My list frequency.</p><p class="desc">I listed like mad in the first week, and I&#39;ve been sporadic ever since. My busiest week had 25 lists. My slowest week had just one.</p></div><img class="popable" src="9.png"></div>

   			<p class="item">My list tone.</p><p class="desc">When I try to be funny my lists are less popular. When the topic is personal the list has slightly above average popularity. And when the topic is serious it does much better. But my most popular lists are serious lists on nerdy topics like Shakespeare, Astronomy, and Language.</p></div><img class="popable" src="11.png"></div>

   			<p class="item">My list formats.</p><p class="desc">My lists of links, requested lists, and open lists did poorly. Ranked lists were right in line with average. Unsurprisingly, lists with lots of pictures did well. *Surprisingly*, wordy lists (like this one) did well too.</p></div><img class="popable" src="12.png"></div>

   			<p class="item">But let&#39;s not forget...</p><p class="desc">I made a lot of connections with people I would otherwise never talk to. I laughed a lot. I was moved a lot. I felt a sort of kinship a time or two with total strangers. I learned about the ðŸ’¯ emoji. I&#39;m not sure how to chart all that.</p></div></div>
