   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s fair to call it a horror story. At the time of course I thought lots of judgmental thoughts about my first college roommate. But looking back I think he probably struggled in ways I didn&#39;t understand.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Anyway...</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">I took the lottery my freshman year and was assigned a room with, let&#39;s call him &#34;Tony&#34;.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">He was super quiet and shy to a degree I&#39;d never seen. I&#39;m shy but he was about eight notches more shy than me.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">He never ever looked me in the eye when we exchanged our few words.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">We lived together for four months and he probably spoke 20 words to me in that time.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">He changed clothes in the closet.</p><p class="desc">It was not a walk-in closet. He had to stoop way down to squeeze in under the shelf and rod and struggle to close the door behind him. He would then emerge in new clothes.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">He watched a lot of porn with his friend late at night on a tiny tiny television while I tried to sleep.</p><p class="desc">I know porn is all accepted and a-ok culturally right now but I think porn is gross and often problematic and it always made me sad the few times I saw it as a teenager.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Sometimes my girlfriend would come over and he would sit on his bed with his back against the wall and watch us talk and kiss.</p><p class="desc">We only did this once because it was super creepy. And also she lived far away.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">I was struggling in college with my own existential crisis and began to wish for a different roommate.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">This was in 1993. It was a different time and I suppose what I&#39;m about to say will seem hard to believe for college folks today, but it seemed sort of normal then I&#39;m sorry to say.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">On another floor in our dorm it was discovered that two young men were gay and involved in a relationship. When this came to light, in accordance with the dark time, they both immediately dropped out of school and disappeared. ðŸ˜¢</p><p class="desc">I sometimes think about these guys and hope that they found a more accepting place to learn and grow.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Anyway, this left an open room. So I moved in to that room with an old friend, Casey.</p><p class="desc">The room was &#34;tainted&#34; socially because it was the &#34;gross gay room&#34; so it was easy for Casey and I to get it. Nobody else wanted it.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">He and I both struggled in an existential way but we struggled together and it made a difference.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">He is such a kind man and he helped me a lot. I will always be grateful that I was able to finish that school year with Casey.</p><p class="desc">Still to this day he checks in occasionally and asks about my brother (who has had some health problems). He is one of the kindest people I ever knew.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">And as for Tony? I never spoke to him again. I sincerely hope he found someone to live with that he felt closer to.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">The next year I dropped out of school. I married my wife a few months later and never had another roommate.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Hmm. I guess the only horror story here is how two young gay men had their education aborted and their social lives upended simply by being.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Although I did not participate in any direct cruelty (and would not have â€” not my style) I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t stand up for them publicly.</p></div></div>
