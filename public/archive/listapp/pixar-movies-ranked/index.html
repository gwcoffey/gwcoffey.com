   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">[Cars 2 and Monsters University]</p><p class="desc">I didn&#39;t see these so I can&#39;t comment.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Cars</p><p class="desc">I liked this movie but it just wasn&#39;t super memorable. The protagonist was kind of a tool. The southwest landscape was very very beautiful though.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">A Bug&#39;s Life</p><p class="desc">Good but not great. Haven&#39;t watched it in years and only ever rewatched it because I had small children and we had it on DVD.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">The Incredibles</p><p class="desc">I wanted to love this because Brad Bird&#39;s Iron Giant is one of the best animated films on earth but I found it noisy and brash and lacking in heart. Not bad, just not moving in any way.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Up</p><p class="desc">This was a beautiful movie but I didn&#39;t love it the way the critics did. I thought it was a little uneven. But still the first of the &#34;only Pixar makes animated movies like this&#34; collection. Full of heart.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Finding Nemo</p><p class="desc">This is an empathically stressful movie. Poor five year old @imc was destroyed by the death of the mom and babies and that was in the first ten minutes. We had to recuperate in the theater lobby for a few minutes. But that&#39;s not a fair critique. It is a great movie although I think the ending is too drawn out taking away from the payoff. The whole fish in the net scene is completely unnecessary.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">The Good Dinosaur</p><p class="desc">Focused on a younger audience so it lacked the complexity I love in Pixar but still very beautiful and very touching.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Toy Story 2</p><p class="desc">To say this is the least good Toy Story is hardly faint praise. A worthy addition to the best animated trilogy ever.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Monster&#39;s, Inc.</p><p class="desc">I loved the sweetness of this movie and @imc was just the right age so I remember seeing it in the theater very fondly.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Toy Story</p><p class="desc">This is both a wonderful movie and a piece of film history.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Ratatouille</p><p class="desc">This movie moves up in my ranking both because it is a beautiful unapologetic work of love and also for the perfect &#34;review&#34; that ends the movie. &#34;Only now do I truly understand what he meant. Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere.&#34; ðŸ’¯</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Brave</p><p class="desc">Moving, beautiful, genre busting, and important. @sophster said it well in her list. A princess fairy tale with no love interest that dares to say mother/daughter relationships are fragile powerful important things. Perfect.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Toy Story 3</p><p class="desc">The closest I&#39;ve ever come to crying in a movie. Brilliant from beginning to end and overwhelmingly moving. Which is saying something when you&#39;re being asked to identify with a cowboy doll. Impeccable.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">WALL-E</p><p class="desc">This movie quietly, meticulously celebrates companionship and what it means to truly be human. It is a brave concept, a brave implementation, and so so beautiful.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Inside Out</p><p class="desc">I went into this movie expecting to be impressed and I was not at all disappointed. It is so smart, so subtle, so willing to stake everything on something so small and fragile and so deeply important. And it&#39;s &#34;message&#34; is unique and critical. Only Pixar.</p></div></div>
