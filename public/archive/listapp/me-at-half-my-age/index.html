   			<p class="item">I work at CompUSA ostensibly selling Macintosh computers but really mostly providing lots of support and advice to regular customers while doing a terrible job actually &#34;upselling&#34; or &#34;closing&#34; or all the other stuff good salespeople do that I&#39;m terrible at. I worry that I don&#39;t do a good job. I wonder if I&#39;ll ever be good at anything.</p></div></div>

There is a pervasive back-of-the-mind terror that I will be a &#34;failure&#34; although I&#39;m not self-aware enough to think of it in those terms.</p></div></div>

I am doing better in school this time around mostly because I want to do well for her. I don&#39;t want her to have put her trust in me foolishly.</p></div></div>

   			<p class="item">People are starting to make fun of the way I talk. I will say &#34;gracious&#34; as an exclamation at work and one of my coworkers will say I talk like an old lady, getting a laugh. Shortly after a waitress will ask how I&#39;m doing and when I say &#34;quite fine thank you&#34; she will say &#34;Oh quite quite! Oh indeed!&#34; while patting her chest, and then laugh.</p></div></div>

   			<p class="item">I will help a man with a computer problem and he will compliment me graciously. He will give me his business card as a senior manager at McDonnell Douglas working on rotor-wing aircraft. He will tell me to call him and come see the facilities and meet some of the programmer staff. Foolishly, I will never call because I don&#39;t want to be a burden.</p></div></div>

   			<p class="item">I will pick up a novel for the first time in a coupe of years. Almost the first time ever by my own volition. Les Miserables. It will change my life in some small way, like a slight bending of the trajectory of a comet, almost imperceptible when it happens but totally changing where it ends up a thousand years later.</p></div></div>

   			<p class="item">This reminds me of a story I heard once from a religious leader about his particular version of struggle, illustrated by a day with a car broken down on the highway and a young family barely making it. He said years later he drove down the same road and imagined he saw himself walking along and &#34;his hands did hang down.&#34; He spoke to the apparition.</p></div></div>
