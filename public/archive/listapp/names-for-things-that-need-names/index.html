		This post is archived from my account on <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3058979/why-people-love-bj-novaks-list">li.st</a>, a social media app that shut down in 2017. Some posts have been edited slightly to fix typographical errors and correctly represent the gender of some individuals. You can <a href="/archive/listapp/">view the full archive here</a>.

<p>Some of these are real. Some are my proposals.</p>
<ul class="listapp">

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Canadian Standoff</p><p class="desc">When you cross paths with someone and you step right and they step right and then you step left and they step left and then you chuckle awkwardly and you both say &#34;you go ahead&#34; and then you both say &#34;sorry&#34; and eventually sort of awkwardly sort it out.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Battery Fatigue</p><p class="desc">When you consciously decide not to buy something only because it is one more thing you&#39;ll have to plug in every night.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Farkling</p><p class="desc">When you&#39;re trying to get something done but every step in the process requires a little work and then a few minutes of waiting so every step you complete is followed by an hour of reading the Internet or listing or whatever such that a 45 minute task takes three days.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Eary</p><p class="desc">A song that is super easy to just listen to and like and hum along to.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Sun-struck</p><p class="desc">When you&#39;ve been in a dark place like a movie theater and then you go outside and it is midday and you are staggered by how bright the world is.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Radiant chill</p><p class="desc">When the sun is hot and direct and the air is cold so you can feel a chill everywhere but where the sun touches your skin.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Mansthetic</p><p class="desc">The striking juxtaposition of natural beauty and the evidence of man. For instance the power lines and the silhouetted palm trees against the pale evening sky to the west.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Jamais Vu</p><p class="desc">When the world you know well and have known all your life seems suddenly in some way large or small to be unfamiliar to you. Sort of the opposite of deja vu. Like when suddenly the leaves on the trees seem strange in their movement, and the rising and falling of the world as you walk seems so noticeable, and you feel entirely apart from the world you occupy until the feeling passes.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Senti-Mentality</p><p class="desc">When you&#39;ve been away from your family for a few days and it is late and you are a little lonely and you read or write something that seems SO DEEPLY MOVING AND POWERFUL. But you know that when you revisit it in a saner state of mind it won&#39;t seem that way at all.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Creative Uncertainty</p><p class="desc">When the above happens and you genuinely don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because you were in a receptive state of mind before and are dulled now by busyness, or because you were irrationally sentimental before and are now in a right state of mind.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Dry cry</p><p class="desc">When you are deeply moved by something to the point that you get that odd expansive feeling in your face and the top of your throat, and perhaps even a moistening of your eyes, but you don&#39;t cry, you can&#39;t cry, because your dad used to say you were a baby when you cried as a little boy and it somehow became subconsciously impossible to do it anymore.</p></div></div>
   </li>
