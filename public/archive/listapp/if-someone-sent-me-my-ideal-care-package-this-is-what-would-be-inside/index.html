   			<p class="item">Homemade cookies. Good ones that are a bit crips on the edges with some texture and some chew. Surprise me on the type.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">There would be lots of them, enough to share with my family.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">They would be nestled in tissue paper such that once we had eaten them all and I was throwing the packaging away I would find one more hiding in three.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">I would think &#34;oh goody&#34; and divide the last treat four ways so everyone could share in the surprise when they got home.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Then a bit later I would eat my quarter and save the rest for the family.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Then later I would reason that really only the kids need more cookiesâ€”Mamie and I have had plentyâ€”so I&#39;d go ahead and eat one more quarter.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Then I&#39;d realize they are obviously quarters so it would not take a mathematical genius to deduce that I had eaten more than my share.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">To avoid the appearance of selfishness I&#39;d go ahead and eat the rest. Nobody needs to know. And anyway it was my package wasn&#39;t it?</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">I would then feel foolishâ€”I don&#39;t even have the willpower to share a stupid cookie.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">But it was a really good cookie.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">And the package was for me.</p></div></div>
