<p>You will read a lot over the next few weeks about how the filibuster is an essential part of our checks and balances installed by the founders to protect us from the mob. That Republicans have unilaterally undermined that protection. This is baloney. (My primary source is: <a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/jlpp/Gold_Gupta_JLPP_article.pdf">http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/jlpp/Gold_Gupta_JLPP_article.pdf</a> )</p>

   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">

   <li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">We can safely assume this because when the constitution *does* care about super-majorities, it is always explicit. For example:</p></div></div>

   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Except in the six cases where the constitution explicitly requires a super-majority in congress, a simple majority is assumed.</p><p class="desc">For example, as you know, it requires a simple majority in each house to pass a law (which the president may veto).</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">When the first Senate convened in 1787, one of the first orders of business was to establish the “Rules of its Proceedings” as authorized by the constitution.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">After some debate, the Senate settled on 20 rules, most of which are very dry and boring. One was the “previous question” rule:</p><p class="desc">“The previous question being moved and seconded, the question for the chair shall be: ’Shall the main question now be put?’ and if the nays prevail, the main question shall not then be put.”</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">It allowed any Senator to make a motion for “the previous question” meaning they suggest debate be ended and the original question under debate be considered.</p><p class="desc">Unless a simple majority of Senators disagreed (“if the nays prevail”), debate would end.</p></div></div>

   			<p class="item">Ultimately these rules are interpreted and enforced by the president of the Senate.</p><p class="desc">(An office filled by the Vice President of the United States.)</p></div></div>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">In 1806, then Vice President Aaron Burr suggested that some of the rules were unnecessary. In particular he pointed out that the “previous question” rule had only been used one time in the prior four years.</p><p class="desc">Obviously, he argued, the rule wasn’t really necessary.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">The rule was removed, and as an oversight, the Senate failed to implement any new rule to terminate debate.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">At that moment it became theoretically possible for one Senator to perpetuate debate for as long as he or she had the stamina, blocking all Senate progress in the process.</p><p class="desc">(The racist Strom Thurmond famously demonstrated this when he spoke for 24 hours and 18 minutes straight to block the Civil Rights act.)</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">But we know Burr was not arguing for this power. Filibusters didn’t really enter anybody’s mind at the time.</p><p class="desc">The idea of using “dilatory” tactics to delay procedure was considered undignified. As Senator Clifford Case explained, “the body observed dignity and restraint in debate, and did not consider talking to consume time a parliamentary instrument appropriate for the Senate”</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">And this is supported by this simple fact:</p><p class="desc">It never once happened for more than 30 years. Not until 1837 did the first Senator filibuster, when a small group of Senators loyal to Andrew Jackson blocked all action in the Senate until the censure of Jackson was removed from the Senate record.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Other minority groups in the Senate obviously took notice. By 1841, the Senate realized it had a problem. It began trying to undo the filibuster.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Senate heavyweights like Henry Clay argued forcefully for the “previous question” rule to be reinstated, restoring majority control of the Senate.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">But the existence of the filibuster itself made the rule change difficult. A small minority of Senators could bring all business in the Senate to a halt rather than allow the the rule change to be voted on.</p></div></div>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">

   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Finally the dam broke in 1917.

   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">This, 1917, is when what we now call the “nuclear option” first came into play. At the time it was called the “constitutional option”.</p><p class="desc">(It is probably more correct to say the Nuclear Option is the application of the Constitutional Option to force cloture with a simple majority vote, but they are closely related.)</p></div></div>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Several Senators including the venerable Henry Cabot Lodge and Thomas Walsh suggested that this situation was unconstitutional.</p></div></div>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">And it is understood that such determinations are by simple majority. As Senator Walsh eloquently put it:</p><p class="desc">“A majority may adopt the rules, in the first place.

   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Legally, he argued, a Senate in session in 1806 had passed, by simple majority, a rule change which now prevented a simple majority from changing the rules. But the Constitution clearly indicates that the majority in the Senate makes the rules.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">His argument was more complex than this, but this is the gist:</p><p class="desc">The Senate acting alone cannot amend or overrule the Constitution. So a past Senate majority cannot deny future Senate majorities their Constitutionally guaranteed rights.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Critical to this maneuver was the idea that the rules were not yet in play. Otherwise, even considering his interpretation would be open to debate and filibuster.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Walsh argued that the Senate is not a continuous body. Rather, in each term, a new Senate convenes. At that moment, it has no established rules.</p><p class="desc">And so it is operating under those well-understood parliamentary rules.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">For the prior 111 years, each new Senate had de facto adopted the prior Senate’s rules, but, he argued, they are under no obligation to do so forever.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">This is not as radical as it sounds. The House, for instance, has operated this way since 1860. Every time a new term of the House of Representatives convenes, their first order of business is to write their rules for the session.</p><p class="desc">(Which usually involves adopting the old rules.)</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
