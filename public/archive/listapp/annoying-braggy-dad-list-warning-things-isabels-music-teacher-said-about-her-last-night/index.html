<p>@imc&rsquo;s high school has a cool tradition called Senior Tribute Night where the teaches prepare a roughly 2 minute speech about each and every graduating senior. Students and parents then get to hear smart, heartfelt, funny tributes to all these awesome kids. Isabel&rsquo;s beloved music teacher did hers. It was so sweet. Here are some things she said.</p>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">

   			<p class="item">&#34;Isabel is passionate about her studies. Sometimes too passionate. Often thinking the worst of her abilities and doubting her accomplishments. It&#39;s at those times that I get the many expressions of Isabel...&#34;</p><p class="desc">Here she held up giant posters of various exasperated emoji faces to go with Isabel&#39;s various frustrations including &#34;I failed my physics test&#34; ðŸ˜§, &#34;I&#39;m so stressed out&#34; ðŸ˜« and &#34;I wish the rest of the choir would shut their mouths and rehearse&#34; ðŸ˜¡.</p></div></div>

   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
