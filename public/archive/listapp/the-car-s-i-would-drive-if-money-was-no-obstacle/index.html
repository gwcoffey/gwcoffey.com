   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">1956 Ford Fairlane</p><p class="desc">Because my dad restored one of these when he was a teenager and only drove it for a few months after turning 16 before he misbehaved and his father made him sell it. He still talks about how much he loved that old car and I&#39;d love to take a day trip in one with him.</p></div><img class="popable" src="3.jpg"></div>
