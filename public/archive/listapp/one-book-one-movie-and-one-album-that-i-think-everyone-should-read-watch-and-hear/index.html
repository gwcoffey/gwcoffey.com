   			<p class="item">Book: Sophie&#39;s World by Jostein Gaarder</p><p class="desc">Trying to pick a book is like trying to choose which breath was most important to you. Some were exhilarating. Some felt life saving. Some were difficult, even painful. All of them were necessary. I picked this one because it is a favorite but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve listed about it before, it is easy and approachable enough for anybody to read at almost any age, and if you&#39;re even passively interested in western thought and what it means to be human this book will thrill you. As a bonus it is sweet.</p></div><img class="popable" src="1.jpg"></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Movie: Ghost World</p><p class="desc">I have a few favorite movies but Ghost World is one of the best, and the one you&#39;re least likely to have seen. Hilarious, dark, sad, touching, and maybe hopeful, with themes of self discovery, self hatred, the appeal and dangers of cynicism, and finding a place for your true self in a world that doesn&#39;t leave a lot of room for unbridled expression, and doesn&#39;t always give us much to hope for. It is so moving it hurts, and the lead Enid is played by Thora Birch with unqualified perfection.</p></div><img class="popable" src="2.jpg"></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Album: Tom Waits / Rain Dogs</p><p class="desc">Every Tom Waits album really. And John Prine. And James McMurtry. And Iris Dement. And and and. But king of them all is Tom Waits and if I had to pick one of his albums, this would be it. Powerful, irreverent, harrowing, magical, gritty, humorous, all soaked in bourbon and agony.</p></div><img class="popable" src="3.jpg"></div>
