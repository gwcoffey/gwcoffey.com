<ul class="listapp">

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Do you hate your birthday because of all the attention?</p><p class="desc">No but: I secretly find all the Facebook attention annoying and disingenuous and I dread having to make a chipper reply to everyone (which is itself deeply disingenuous). And I never have parties. And my family knows I like to keep it low key and they lovingly oblige.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Do you think I&#39;m a diva because I LOVE my birthday?</p><p class="desc">Not at all. In fact I love that you love your birthday and I would love to make you a treat.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Do I talk too loudly?</p><p class="desc">Well, yes but that&#39;s ok. It certainly isn&#39;t my place to police your joy. And if you&#39;re loud about what you love I don&#39;t mind so much. If you&#39;re loud about what you hate I judge you with my eyes.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Do you take a lot of bubble baths?</p><p class="desc">I do love a hot bath now and again. With my kindle in a ziploc bag. So relaxing.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">How many cats do you have.</p><p class="desc">Two. ðŸ˜³</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Did you read Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can&#39;t Stop Talking</p><p class="desc">Yes indeed. Susan Cain&#39;s Ted talk was hugely eye opening to me in that I heard this person describing all the parts of me I always thought were weird, regrettable, broken, and unusual. Her book was a really big deal to me.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Do you think your job and/or school lends itself to the success of extroverts over introverts?</p><p class="desc">I would say no. I&#39;m a programmer so I&#39;m not exactly alone at work as an introvert. And my employer is enlightened, empowering, supportive, and smart. I&#39;ve been lucky that both &#34;giant companies&#34; I&#39;ve worked for have had flexible introvert-friendly models of success.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">How long is the perfect amount of time to stay at a party?</p><p class="desc">This will sound so grumpy, but zero minutes. I&#39;ve never been comfortable at a party in my life. But! It is important to people I love (both people I go with and hosts) and so it is a small sacrifice to make an appearance when appropriate. If my wife is having a ball I&#39;ll stay as long as she wants. Otherwise we&#39;ll leave after maybe an hour. But not too often please.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Will you be my friend?</p><p class="desc">Yes! Can we talk about how beautiful the world is? Can we watch Shakespeare? Can we cook together? Can we go for long meandering walks with not real destination? I&#39;ll do stuff you like too. And most importantly, can we be friends for ever and ever even if we don&#39;t &#34;do&#34; anything for long stretches? Even if I don&#39;t stay in touch very well? Even if I sometimes don&#39;t call? I&#39;m sorry to ask this of you but I know enough about myself to know it will happen. I&#39;ll make up for it by giving and giving.</p></div></div>
   </li>
