And then Virgil would write an epic poem about Dan Brown and the cycle would be complete.</p></div></div>

Such efforts attack the very idea that made-up stories can matter, which is sort of the foundational assumption of our species.</p></div></div>

The boy is a boy and the fish is a fish. The shark are all sharks no better and no worse. All the symbolism that people say is shit. What goes beyond is what you see beyond when you know.</p></div></div>
