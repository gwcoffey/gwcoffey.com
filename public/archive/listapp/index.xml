      <description>From the Book of the Dead, the Ancient Egyptian funerary text.
I harmed no one.
I made neither my relatives nor my companions unhappy.
I did no vile act on the Abode of Truth.
I had no acquaintance with evil.
I did no evil.
I made no one work beyond their capabilities.
I caused no one to suffer, nor to be fearful, poor or wretched.
I did not do what the gods hate.</description>

      <title>A question for literature nerds...</title>
      <link>http://gwcoffey.com/archive/listapp/a-question-for-literature-nerds/</link>

      <description>One of my favorite passages in Cormac McCarthy&amp;#39;s All The Pretty Horses comes about three quarters of the way through...
The hero has been through hell and he&amp;#39;s about to find out if it was all worth it. In some sense everything in the book has been pointing to what is about to happen.
All this intensity has built up…
...and then he&amp;#39;s forced to wait.
If I remember right, he&amp;#39;s literally waiting for a train.</description>

      <description>The one where you know someone is behind you.
The one where you know a friend has had a bad day.
The one where you&amp;#39;re forgetting something and you know it but you have no idea what it is.
The one where you know you&amp;#39;re getting sick even though you have no symptoms.
The one where you&amp;#39;re holding a flimsy full plastic drink cup and you know it&amp;#39;s on the verge of slipping even though it hasn&amp;#39;t slipped yet.</description>

Assassin

Coward
mid-13c., from Old French coart &amp;#34;coward&amp;#34; from coe &amp;#34;tail,&amp;#34; from Latin coda, popular dialect variant of cauda &amp;#34;tail,&amp;#34;; The word probably reflects an animal metaphoric sense still found in expressions like turning tail and tail between legs.
Fanatic

      <title>Everything You Ever Wanted to Know about the Filibuster</title>
      <link>http://gwcoffey.com/archive/listapp/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-the-filibuster/</link>

      <guid>http://gwcoffey.com/archive/listapp/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-the-filibuster/</guid>
      <description>You will read a lot over the next few weeks about how the filibuster is an essential part of our checks and balances installed by the founders to protect us from the mob. That Republicans have unilaterally undermined that protection. This is baloney. (My primary source is: http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/jlpp/Gold_Gupta_JLPP_article.pdf )
The filibuster allows a minority party in the senate to undermine progress through “dilatory” debate: debate only for the purpose of delay, rather than persuasion.</description>

      <title>Trepidatious is apparently not a word*</title>
      <link>http://gwcoffey.com/archive/listapp/trepidatious-is-apparently-not-a-word/</link>

      <description>I love language. Learned this the other day. Follow the steps&amp;hellip; (* in the prescriptivist sense. It is obviously a word by usage.)
There&amp;#39;s an old word &amp;#34;Trepid&amp;#34;. OED calls it &amp;#34;rare&amp;#34; meaning nobody really uses it anymore. It is an adjective.
Fun fact: from Latin, related to &amp;#34;trep-&amp;#34; &amp;#34;to tremble&amp;#34;.
Aside: From trepid we get the much more common word &amp;#34;Intrepid.&amp;#34;
Not &amp;#34;rare&amp;#34; at all.
Trepid has a noun form &amp;#34;Trepidation&amp;#34; from the Latin Trepidare → Trepidationem.</description>

      <description>Professional advice from a computer professional.
Check to see if anybody has already responded informing the sender of the mistake.
If so DO NOTHING. It will end eventually.
If not, reply ONLY to the sender informing them of the error. Ask them to reply to the original email, explain the mistake, and move everyone to the BCC list on the reply.
This way hopefully the impending flood of future replies will only go to the original sender.</description>

      <description>Spitballing here. There&amp;rsquo;s definitely a speculative conspiratorial undercurrent here for which I apologize.

      <description>For years I carried a normal wallet like this.
But I always hated sitting on it
I tried extra thin wallets.
And I was militant about getting rid of cards I didn&amp;#39;t need to carry. I was never satisfied.
When I first got an iPhone 6 I really really hated how big it was. In desperation I tried a wallet case thinking it might actually make it easier to hold.</description>

      <description>I liked the move and I&amp;rsquo;ve only seen it once so I may be wrong on one or two of these but what gives? The previews were assembled mostly from scenes and lines that weren&amp;rsquo;t in the movie.
This line...
&amp;#34;Imperial flags reign across the galaxy&amp;#34;
This line...
&amp;#34;I rebel&amp;#34;
This line...
&amp;#34;A major weapons test is imminent&amp;#34;
This line...
&amp;#34;Now I fight the empire&amp;#34;

      <description>Sentimentally skewed by the order/age in which I read them. Featuring the covers I owned. Limiting myself to major works I read cover to cover here.
My first, around age 15. Probably higher ranking than it deserves because it blew my little teenage mind.
My third, also when I was 15. Probably my actual favorite.
Not until I was 17 or 18 but up-ranked by awesomeness.
My fifth, when I was 16.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve always had the sense that maybe my perception is broken.
Like sometimes people talk about how beautiful some instrumental music is...
And I kind of think asking which of two noises is prettier...
Is like asking which of two colors tastes better.
It&amp;#39;s sound right? I mean I can tell when something is grating and awful but above that threshold it&amp;#39;s all kind of an ambiguous mash of &amp;#34;sure sounds fine I guess.</description>

      <description>Brakes don&amp;#39;t work.
Usually when backing up.
Driving across an irrationally rickety bridge.
Like two 2x4s stretched across an enormous chasm.
Fall in the water.
Have to cross the water carefully without falling in.
Have to get in the water but it is gross and dirty.
Apparently I have a thing with water.
Alligators.
In many precarious situations. I really really really really hate alligators when I&amp;#39;m asleep.

Green bean casserole.
All from scratch because that&amp;#39;s the way I roll.
3-to-1 mashed potatoes.
Six pounds of russets, two pounds of European butter.
Potato leek soup
With homemade créme fraîche. Made special for @sophster the vegetarian.
Some bread.
First time trying the recipe. Needs more salt. And I need to up my braiding game.</description>

      <description>I wrote this last night on Facebook (where I go to be close to the people I know personally). I&amp;rsquo;m still processing but I thought it probably had a place here too.
America learned a lesson tonight. I think it is fair to say that Trump found a market for his populist appeal despite his hatefulness, and we who were so deeply opposed to his presidency should not ignore that. Many Trump supporters don’t trust their leaders to attend to their needs.</description>

      <description>From Rabindranath Tagore&amp;rsquo;s immeasurably beautiful Gitanjali.
&amp;#34;
On the day when the lotus bloomed, alas, my mind was straying, and I knew it not. My basket was empty and the flower remained unheeded.
Only now and again a sadness fell upon me, and I started up from my dream and felt a sweet trace of a strange fragrance in the south wind.
That vague sweetness made my heart ache with longing and it seemed to me that it was the eager breath of the summer seeking for its completion.</description>

      <description>Sentimental ~ This is unearned emotion. If you tell me she&amp;#39;s devastated, if you tell me her voice cracks, if you show me her tears, none of that matters if any of it had to be said.
&amp;#34;Like great works, deep feelings always mean more than they are conscious of saying.&amp;#34; — Albert Camus
Contrived ~ This is unearned circumstance. He can&amp;#39;t just think very hard or be especially earnest to make his weakness disappear.</description>

      <description>Liberals rigging the republican primaries.
The media rigging the republican primaries.
God giving a sinful world what it deserves.
The &amp;#34;shadow government&amp;#34; &amp;#34;consolidating power&amp;#34; (?) via a Clinton presidency by forcing (?) a challenger who is unelectable to make her seem more palatable to the &amp;#34;sheep&amp;#34;. (🐑)
No seriously one of them just posted about this a few minutes ago. Aside: I&amp;#39;ve said it all along and I&amp;#39;ll say it again: Julian Assange is nutso even if he sometimes accidentally does the world a favor.</description>

      <description>My cat waits for me to pee.
He waits very patiently.
At my feet.
And when I stand he stands.
And looks up excitedly.
I flush.
And he jumps up on the toilet seat.
He watches the water swirl.
With obvious feline anticipation.
And then he drinks.
A long careful deliberate drink.
Every time.
But only when I use the guest bathroom.
He has a water bowl.
This is weird right?</description>

      <description>Look.
There&amp;#39;s a lot of talk about the Trump/Clinton equivalency.
&amp;#34;Trump may be bad, but Clinton is a liar, a crook, and maybe even a murderer.&amp;#34;
If I push back against these claims I get drowned in a torrent of half-truths, misinformation, and links to right-wing blogs with shady stories of unknown provenance.
Some of this is &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; in the sense that Clinton has made some very stupid mistakes (E.</description>

      <description>This finally makes sense to me.
You know how the moon often looks bigger on the horizon than when it is high in the sky?
Of course the moon hasn&amp;#39;t actually changed size.
This is the &amp;#34;Moon Illusion&amp;#34;.
But perhaps you will be surprised to learn that it&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;apparent size&amp;#34; (which is to say it&amp;#39;s measurable angular size — how big it actually looks to your physical eyes) is also unchanged.</description>

You can talk the tongue of Angels
You can walk the thin white line
Raid your heart&amp;#39;s imagination
Let your thoughts live and run wild
But now all I see is this station
And the boats with the sun in their wake
Looking out on Scalpay dawning
And you drenched in the rain of grace

      <description>The long &amp;#34;boring&amp;#34; parts of novels like Les Miserbales and Moby Dick.
I could read Melville blathering about whale representation in art for days and days.
Getting my teeth cleaned.
Wish I could go to the dentist every day.
Overcooked casseroles.
I love the dried out/crispy bits. Let it go 20% longer.
Podcasts and audio books on 2x speed.
Why does everyone talk so slowly?
History.
Never not interesting.</description>

      <description>The problem with television is it all happens so fast.
Like I&amp;#39;m about to finally get around to watching West Wing.
Because everyone said it was really really good.
But we&amp;#39;re past that now right?
Should I just skip right past Sopranos, Downton Abbey, and Game of Thrones...
...And dive right in to Stranger Things or whatever it is called?
I guess what I mean is how do you get on this moving train without losing your legs?</description>

      <description>When you&amp;#39;re treading water
Alone
Deep in the middle of the Pacific Ocean
Waves rolling high as far as the eye can see
With nothing to grasp and nothing in sight
But blue blue blue blue
You realize
Just then
That there&amp;#39;s not much difference
Between big…
And infinite.</description>

      <description>Filling out paperwork with pen and paper like some 20th century troglodyte.
Answering the same questions you&amp;#39;ve answered a million times.
Waiting room chairs that are lower to the ground than normal chairs and have low backs and sharp-edged arm rests making it 100% impossible to get comfortable.
TVs distractingly blathering while you&amp;#39;re trying to read.
Two levels of air conditioning: Chilled air directly on your neck or stuffy and hot.</description>

I didn&amp;#39;t actually see secret footage of Obama paying a ransom. It was actually a Samuel L Jackson film. But you know how all black people look the same?
I wasn&amp;#39;t actually angry at a crying baby. I was a baby once. Babies can be fantastic.
I don&amp;#39;t actually judge women exclusively by their sex appeal. I was just making a point about misogyny.</description>

      <description>SPOILERS for Terminator, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child ahead.
What is it about sequels of time travel stores that they don&amp;#39;t seem to understand the mechanics of their own predecessor?
For instance, in the greatest time travel movie of all time...
Duh
The first film pretty clearly implies that time travel can&amp;#39;t change anything.

      <description>This is an ill-formed set of primordial thoughts demanding deeper understanding on my part. Stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about a lot.
Assumption #1: We elect presidents and making that selection should be democratic.
(It isn&amp;#39;t terribly democratic right now given our electoral system and I&amp;#39;m still on the fence about pros/cons of that but that&amp;#39;s a different list.)
Assumption #2: We don&amp;#39;t elect candidates. Anybody can run for president if they meet the constitutional requirements.</description>

Have you selected a color scheme?
Who designed your tie?
Have you been working out?
Do you really think bespoke tailored suites are the kind of thing ordinary Americans can identify with?
You&amp;#39;ve changed your hair!
No question, just an observation.
Do you really think it is the place of someone in your position to dip into the political fray?</description>

      <description>My kids&amp;rsquo; elementary school had a form you had to sign when you were late. It asked why you were late. This is none of their business of course (not that I fault them for asking). These are the reasons I gave over the years. I hope they&amp;rsquo;re in a database somewhere.
Misplaced glass eye.
Tragic boating accident.
Incident with dental floss and goldfish.
Turns out the school is EAST.</description>

      <description>Fair disclosure: I&amp;#39;m not really a fan of the original. I genuinely don&amp;#39;t get why it is so popular. I was really young when I first saw it though so maybe that tainted me.
I have tried twice to re-watch it as an adult but got bored and turned it off both times. None of this is a dig at the movie itself. Lots of people I admire love this movie like a child.</description>

      <description>Inspired by @wallflower, who I respect immensely but she is misguided. From Rainbow Doughnuts in north phoenix (not the same as rainbow doughnuts in east phoenix).
5 glazed raised.
The best overall doughnut.
2 apple fritters.
The best imposter doughnut.
2 glazed buttermilk.
So good.
2 chocolate buttermilk.
Ditto.
2 Boston cream.
But only if it&amp;#39;s pastry cream inside. If it&amp;#39;s frosting-filled, cancel your order and burn the place down.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m an expert French Toast maker here to tell you what you&amp;rsquo;re doing wrong. With apologies to @Lisa_Fav and @MaiaLS; I&amp;rsquo;m sure this stuff isn&amp;rsquo;t really French.
Eggy coated bready bread.
Caused by a quick dip of fresh bread in eggy batter. Gag.
Soggy bread goop.
Caused by a prolonged soak of fresh bread.
Crispy-edged custard-centered perfection.
The secrets to French Toast are: 1: Use good quality STALE bread. 2: Swap half the egg for just EGG YOLK.</description>

She looks meek but she wants to destroy America.
This lawyer answering questions about the ills of for-profit prisons and inequity in the justice system.
Thug.

      <description>Everybody knows the four elements are:
Earth
Wind
Fire
Water
(Some ivory tower academics have proposed a ludicrously complex system with over a hundred supposed elements, an idea so absurd I see no reason to refute it.)
These elements, in mixtures of various amounts, make up all around us.
He imbued the elements with consciousness and in that way made life.
From wind He made angels.
From fire the most vile devils.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I&amp;rsquo;ve never made this list.
1989-90: Akard&amp;#39;s True Value Hardware — Stocker/Customer Assistance
My first real job when I turned 14. Full time in the summer, part time during school. The owner was like something out of a made-for-tv remake of a Dickens novel: A beady-eyed hunched-over monster who sat in his upstairs office peering out his window at everyone in the store and counting money. I hated him.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve always thought the most famous line from the Declaration of Independence is hilariously snarky.
&amp;#34;We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.&amp;#34;
It&amp;#39;s funny right?
Like the Jeffersonian equivalent of &amp;#34;duh, obv.&amp;#34;

We could all use a little of that.

I love that she sewed that dress herself.</description>

      <description>@list database administrator.
So I could go find all the lists with this title and change &amp;#34;an option&amp;#34; (which really doesn&amp;#39;t make sense) to &amp;#34;a concern&amp;#34;. The expression, of course, is &amp;#34;money is no OBJECT&amp;#34; but even that&amp;#39;s wrong because we&amp;#39;re not suggesting we&amp;#39;d pay any price for this career. We&amp;#39;re just saying if we didn&amp;#39;t care about making money, right? I mean I guess technically taking a huge pay cut could be considered paying a price, but that&amp;#39;s stretching it.</description>

Once when @imc was a few weeks old I forgot her in the car when I went in to FedEx to pick up a package.
I ran back out a minute later and thankfully she wasn&amp;#39;t crushed by a giant gorilla.
Once when @sophster was a baby we turned our back for a minute and she climbed her high chair and then fell off.</description>

      <description>@Lisa_Fav
It&amp;#39;s true.
She&amp;#39;s wonderful.
She makes cheesecake.
Or anyway she did once.
And some guy who is apparently somebody signed her shirt once.
That was pretty cool I guess.
The best thing about Lisa is she is French.
And everybody knows French girls are wonderful.
Because French.
Marchon! Marchon!
@MaiaLS taught me that.
Also she thinks a mixer is called a robot.
🤖
That makes me very happy.
Anyway the important thing is Isabel will be in Paris soon.</description>

      <title>The Twin Paradox</title>

      <guid>http://gwcoffey.com/archive/listapp/the-twin-paradox/</guid>
      <description>A lot of people think the &amp;#34;twin paradox&amp;#34; of relativity just means if you fly away in a space ship going close to the speed of light you&amp;#39;ll age more slowly than your twin at home and then you&amp;#39;ll paradoxically have twins two different ages.
While perhaps surprising that isn&amp;#39;t actually paradoxical. And it is wrong.
In fact a fundamental part of &amp;#34;relativity&amp;#34; is that movement is relative.
If you are in a spaceship moving away from earth at near the speed of light then.</description>

Kindergarten: Miss Mason.
Sometimes I think a good chunk of her academic success comes down to her awesome introduction to school. Miss Mason was enthusiastic, fun, firm, hilarious, utterly in control of 25 five year olds, and just infectiously wonderfully kind. We truly loved her.</description>

      <description>This is the Drake Equation.
Sometimes pop-sci articles say it answers the question &amp;#34;is there intelligent life in the universe?&amp;#34;
But that&amp;#39;s not a very good characterization.
It might be more correct to say the Drake equation helps us ask the question more precisely.
After all, the only answer we have to the question &amp;#34;Is there intelligent life in the universe?&amp;#34; is: ¯_(ツ)_/¯
Drake helps us reframe the question. It says &amp;#34;to answer that question here&amp;#39;s everything we need to know.</description>

      <description>@imc&amp;rsquo;s high school has a cool tradition called Senior Tribute Night where the teaches prepare a roughly 2 minute speech about each and every graduating senior. Students and parents then get to hear smart, heartfelt, funny tributes to all these awesome kids. Isabel&amp;rsquo;s beloved music teacher did hers. It was so sweet. Here are some things she said.
Although limited to two minutes, &amp;#34;I could very easily talk for weeks on end about this super-human.</description>

      <description>Thanks for the rec! I&amp;rsquo;m really kind of cheap in the sense that I don&amp;rsquo;t really &amp;ldquo;get&amp;rdquo; buying fancy things like nice cars and clothes. I&amp;rsquo;m a-ok with basic and dependable. And pretty much anytime I buy something frivolous I regret it about 24 hours later. But all these things are more expensive than the alternatives and totally worth it&amp;hellip;

Prerequisite: I am a giant baby. I hate scary movies. Always have. And my definition of scary is broad. I HATED the queen of hearts in the Disney Alice in Wonderland when I was little, for instance. She scared me to death and she was so so so mean.</description>

      <description>This list is impossible but here goes.
Book: Sophie&amp;#39;s World by Jostein Gaarder
Trying to pick a book is like trying to choose which breath was most important to you. Some were exhilarating. Some felt life saving. Some were difficult, even painful. All of them were necessary. I picked this one because it is a favorite but I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve listed about it before, it is easy and approachable enough for anybody to read at almost any age, and if you&amp;#39;re even passively interested in western thought and what it means to be human this book will thrill you.</description>

      <description>Ten bodies in the solar system have stable atmospheres.
All of them have clouds.
Venus
Covered in clouds so thick we can never see the surface.
Earth
A contender for most beautiful clouds in the known universe.
Mars
Thin wispy infrequent white clouds high in the delicate atmosphere.
Jupiter
Look at them. Layers, bands, deep and boiling. Clouds on clouds on clouds all of contrasting colors. Beautiful.
Saturn
Just as complex as Jupiter but far less flashy.</description>

      <description>Regret: I&amp;#39;m not big on regret but that&amp;#39;s a lousy response to the question so I&amp;#39;ll say this: That it took me so long to figure out there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with me and I can do and be and love anything I want.
Sometimes I think the reason I like coming of age stories so much is that I spent so much of my life doing it.
Pride: That I did ok with my kids.</description>

      <description>This is an apology gift to all my new followers, who I mistakenly called spammers. Forgive me. I&amp;rsquo;m not usually so cynical. Wait&amp;hellip;
The problem with The Grinch Who Stole Christmas is it&amp;#39;s bullshit and everyone knows it.
If some jerk really did steal everybody&amp;#39;s presents and decorations and roast beast and everything else you can be sure there wouldn&amp;#39;t be a town-wide kumbayah session come Christmas morning.
First there&amp;#39;d be a whole lot of disappointed kids, and kids don&amp;#39;t always handle disappointment so well.</description>

Do you hate your birthday because of all the attention?
No but: I secretly find all the Facebook attention annoying and disingenuous and I dread having to make a chipper reply to everyone (which is itself deeply disingenuous). And I never have parties. And my family knows I like to keep it low key and they lovingly oblige.

      <description>Inspired by @jennifergster and many more. Sorry this list is so pretentious.
I never really fought with my big sisters.
They were super nice to me.
They told me I was handsome all the time.
Angie made up elaborate games to play with me.
And she took me out to Noble Romans for breadsticks and to talk just the two of us all the time.
Mary read and commented on my school papers.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to make some lists about lyrics I love. I&amp;rsquo;ll start with R.E.M. which was my first lyric love way back in middle school. You kids today don&amp;rsquo;t know what it was like back then listening over and over with headphones and a pen and paper trying to work out the words so you can process them. R.E.M. was the first to put me through that.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not much of a car person so I expanded the scope a bit.
Tesla Model S
Just for a quick drive because I think the continuous acceleration curve would be fun to control.
Indy Car
Again, just once. Would be so cool. I&amp;#39;m probably too tall or something.
1956 Ford Fairlane
Because my dad restored one of these when he was a teenager and only drove it for a few months after turning 16 before he misbehaved and his father made him sell it.</description>

Except that it might inspire interest in science, deepen our understanding of the solar system, and teach us new and interesting things. I guess that&amp;#39;s an impact (yuck yuck yuck).

HATE it. I hate it so much it kind of offends me that it is called chocolate. That&amp;#39;s like calling horse manure &amp;#34;brown gold&amp;#34;. It may be brown but it definitely isn&amp;#39;t gold.
I&amp;#39;m not big on peppermint...
I mean it&amp;#39;s ok I guess but if the choice is between peppermint candy and any other kind I choose other.

Doing this right now and I&amp;#39;m in love.
Take it out of my pocket without standing up.
While in the car even!
Switch to the home screen, open the camera app, flip it sideways, and snap a photo all with one hand.

      <description>I shower every day.
Twice most days in the summer.
I brush my hair kind of quickly.
I used to use hair spray but maybe 18 months ago I ran out as I was leaving for a trip and I realized I don&amp;#39;t actually need it. So I stopped using it. Look how dashing my hair is anyway.
I shave. I don&amp;#39;t have much of a beard though so I skip this step a lot.</description>

8-9:00: Make breakfast for my girls. Waffles, eggs, biscuits, berries, bacon.
Yes they have to be out the door before eight but this is my fantasy so I&amp;#39;m both sleeping in AND making a nice breakfast. The kitchen will already be tidy and clean before I start.
9-12:00: Walk to the library, sit by the windows on the 5th floor, south side, overlooking the arts district and read a book with no stress or obligations.</description>

I own a decent pile of albums (iTunes says I have about 400) and I listen to music every day while I work.
But despite my father&amp;#39;s best efforts I&amp;#39;ve never been blown away or deeply moved by the music itself.
He loves classical, especially piano, and describes some of his listening experiences in almost religious terms. He is genuinely surprised that I&amp;#39;m not able to feel the same way.</description>

Physical Book or eBook?
eBook. Unless it is not available, or the book format works better on paper. But I much prefer e.
Audio book or book in hand?
Both. I can&amp;#39;t pay attention to an audio book very well so all my serious reading is book-in-hand but I do listen to audio books a lot, usually things I&amp;#39;ve already read, and especially things that benefit from good readers like Shakespeare or Joyce.</description>

Yes I talk to her but it is so nice to see what she&amp;#39;s up to passively throughout the week.
My wife cracks me up.
I catch a glimpse of my sweet niece Claire in her tender moments.
I keep abreast of the amazing things going on in the life of my nephew who happens to be non-verbal autistic and is an outspoken champion for acceptance and educational opportunities for all.</description>

Abstruse / Obtuse
Hard to understand vs. unlikely to understand.
Blond / Blonde and Brunet / Brunette
Male/gender neutral vs. female. Does this distinction still exist? Corrected by an editor in an article I wrote once.
Canvas / Canvass
Canvas sail vs. canvass the neighborhood for the sale.
Carat / Karat
Diamonds vs. gold.
Centrifugal / Centripetal
Centrifugal force pushes out, centripetal force pulls in.</description>

I wrote a book about FileMaker Pro. Some day I&amp;#39;ll list about that process which was somewhat harrowing.
I actually wrote five editions of the book. But all but the first were various degrees of revision.
Here are all the great things about this work of high brow literature.
It is chock full of Buffy the Vampire Slayer references.
And some Harry Potter references.</description>

      <description>Because I just watched Eye in the Sky which was basically a (very good) two hour trolley problem.
You are a switch operator and you see there are five people tied up on the tracks. The empty trolley (no passengers and unmanned) is coming and will certainly kill them all. If you throw the switch the trolley will divert down a side track and kill one person who happens to be standing on the track.</description>

Sophie IS amazing!
One amazing thing about her is her self confidence!
She is impossible to embarrass.
One time when we were at Girl Scouts when she was 9 or 10 and a bunch of older girls were there I decided to embarrass her. I grabbed her and kissed her all over the face and called her my &amp;#34;baby boo boo&amp;#34;. She was not embarrassed. She LOVED it. She curled up in my lap and reciprocated so ridiculously that I got very embarrassed in front of all the moms.</description>

      <description>Assume they are competent.
I know you&amp;#39;ve been burned before. So have I. Some people are terrible at what they&amp;#39;re supposed to be doing. But everybody also deserves the benefit of the doubt. So assume their ideas are good, their experience is relevant, and their suggestions are well considered. Question your own assumptions as readily as you question theirs.
Respect existing decisions.
If you&amp;#39;re coming in to an existing project, study the work they&amp;#39;ve already done and assume it was either done that way for a good reason, or at least that it is an acceptable way to do it.</description>

      <description>Optimist
Optimism is a formal enlightenment era philosophy that supposes that the world we live in is the &amp;#34;best possible world&amp;#34; either because the laws of the universe are such that the world is the only way it could possibly be (a sort of tautological optimism) or because a benevolent force (i.e., God) controls the world and optimizes it for goodness. The latter can itself have two interpretations: All is always well from the right perspective, or more commonly that suffering is &amp;#34;for our own good&amp;#34;.</description>

Jef
That&amp;#39;s it.
Otherwise known as Jeff.
Why is it Geoff you ask?
Well, in Medieval Latin there was a name Gaufridus.
It came from Old High German meaning &amp;#34;district of peace&amp;#34; (gewi &amp;#43; fridu).
Aside: The name Frederick also comes from the Old High German fridu &amp;#43; reich meaning peace rule. So my name and Frederick share a common root.
Anyway, the Latin Gaufridus became the Old French name Geuffroi.</description>

Why does he talk that way?

Mostly because he sounds so stupid when he talks.
That voice...how do you not just laugh at how ridiculous it is?

      <description>Never touch another person again.
Or never speak to another person again.
Never use google again.
Or never read a book again.
Give up your favorite food forever.
Or eat only your current favorite food for dinner for the rest of your life.
Have Bill Gates&amp;#39; wealth.
Or have basic necessities for life.
Die by being eaten by a lion.
Or die of starvation.

      <description>In which I share with you all what a happy day this is.
This is @sophster and her very special friend Maia when they were in 4th grade.
Here&amp;#39;s another one with Sophia actually smiling.
Maia always takes beautiful pictures with a big smile. Sophia not so much.
Here she is up close.
They are so close they are practically sisters.
They were best buddies from 4th through 6th grade. But they always knew Maia&amp;#39;s family would move away after sixth grade.</description>

      <description>The teachers awkwardly alternating who&amp;#39;s speaking phase.
The slight head nod at the people you only ever see at parent meetings and have never actually talked to phase.
The stopping repeatedly to hand papers to late comers phase.
The lame joke phase.
The gingery trying to explain some perfectly reasonable policy without offending a hypersensitive parent phase.
The parents ask questions that were just answered phase.
The parents upstage one another with irrationally aggressive concern for their special snowflake phase.</description>

Funny, witty, passionate, complicated.
Eponine
Granted she&amp;#39;s not in the best shape, health wise. Oh and she&amp;#39;s dead. But she will always be special to me because she overcame so much for love and let it go anyway.</description>

Appreciate simplicity, don&amp;#39;t need much, have a low tolerance for people who are in a bad mood, identify with this sentiment entirely: &amp;#34;the most restless wanderer longs in the end for his homeland again and finds in his cottage, in the arms of his wife, in the midst of his children, in the work of looking after them, the joy he had sought in vain in the wide world.</description>

      <description>Apple filed their motion to vacate the court order that they &amp;ldquo;unlock&amp;rdquo; an iPhone yesterday. In other words they&amp;rsquo;ve made their formal argument for why they believe the order is invalid. https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2722199-5-15-MJ-00451-SP-USA-v-Black-Lexus-IS300.html It is quite readable but here&amp;rsquo;re the basics of Apple&amp;rsquo;s 3-part argument.
1️⃣ The All Writs Act does not give the government the authority to make this order because:
- it does not apply if congress has already considered a power and rejected it.</description>

&amp;#34;GIF&amp;#34; stands for &amp;#34;Graphic Interchange Format&amp;#34;. It is a de facto standard for images released by CompuServe in 1987.
Remember CompuServe? Of course you don&amp;#39;t. It is a really old online service kind of like America Online but older. But you all don&amp;#39;t remember that either. It&amp;#39;s like pre-Internet online shopping and social media with a Linux command line. Anyway, it&amp;#39;s old.

Kill me.
I&amp;#39;d prefer you do this quickly and painlessly but that isn&amp;#39;t strictly necessary.
Carefully study my proportions.
Using advanced 3D Printing technology, manufacture a Geoff-suit.
Insinuate yourself into my family and life.
Whenever the lights dim and the opening flourish starts when you&amp;#39;re watching a movie, lean over to the person next to you and say quietly and nervously, &amp;#34;I&amp;#39;m scared. Are you scared?&amp;#34;
This will 100% convince any member of my family that you are really me and go a long way toward glossing over the fact that you didn&amp;#39;t know their names or where the bathroom was in our house.</description>

      <description>I took Spanish in high school.
Our Spanish text book had a series of sidebars called &amp;#34;Nota Cultural&amp;#34; (&amp;#34;Cultural Note&amp;#34;) with tidbits of wisdom.
One of these was about a supposed Spanish phrase, &amp;#34;¡El mundo es un pañuelo!&amp;#34;
Literally &amp;#34;the world is a handkerchief&amp;#34; but ostensibly meaning &amp;#34;oh what a small world!&amp;#34;
For spring break my senior year we took a school trip to Paris.
While at the Louvre a couple approached me and asked me if I would take their picture.</description>

PARALLEL UNIVERSES
By Etgar Keret
There’s a theory that says there are billions of other universes, parallel to the one we live in, and that each of them is slightly different.
There are the ones where you were never born, and the ones where you wouldn’t want to be born.</description>

      <description>Inspired by @ListPrompts. Immortality sucks.
When you say &amp;#34;immortal&amp;#34; do you mean I&amp;#39;m entirely exempt from death?
Or that I no longer age but I&amp;#39;m still subject to disease and injury? Can a bus still run over me and kill me?
And am I otherwise normal?
Or is this immortality in some angelic sense where I occupy a universe apart from the one we know?

My friend would always tell me about water levels and finger joints and I&amp;rsquo;d be like &amp;ldquo;doesn&amp;rsquo;t that depend on the size of the pot?!&amp;rdquo; Anyway, if you want fluffy rice with separate grains then this recipe is fool-proof and also requires no measuring.

Some things haven&amp;#39;t been great.
But I love them anyway.
They&amp;#39;re as much a part of me as everything else.
I&amp;#39;ve made some mistakes. Some big ones.
Sometimes I&amp;#39;ve hurt people and I guess I wish I could make that go away.
I&amp;#39;m sorry. 😢

      <description>Proserpine (Persephone to the Greeks)
This is my number one: She inhabits the underworld which fits a body so deep in the dark. Proserpine was stolen into the underworld and there is some thought that Planet Nine was kicked into the outer solar system early in its formation. She is often associated with the coming forth and withdrawal of seasons which has a nice symmetry with Planet Nine&amp;#39;s supposed highly eccentric orbit.</description>

Everything in this &amp;ldquo;recipe&amp;rdquo; can be adjusted/swapped/augmented in a million ways which is one of the things that makes tacos so wonderful. 🌮🌮🌮
Corn tortillas, toasted in a dry pan to warm them up and make them a little toasty.
I prefer corn but hey I love soft tacos on four tortillas too, and I love crispy tacos too.</description>

      <description>This is how you make Cebolla en Escabeche (sometimes called Cebollita), the beautiful, super simple, mild &amp;ldquo;pickled&amp;rdquo; red onion they serve at street side taco stands in Mexico.
Cut a red onion in half, slice it thin, and put it in a bowl. Pour boiling water to cover the onion. Count to ten, then immediately drain off the water.
This makes the onions a bit softer and takes a bit of the edge off.</description>

My cat attacked my thumb and &amp;#34;scratched&amp;#34; it so deeply it bled profusely and I had to put on a bandaid. It is much more a deep cut than a scratch. I did not know those little monsters could do that.
Say hi Sadness.

      <description>This was one of the most eye opening things I ever learned.
The &amp;#34;Fundamental Attribution Error&amp;#34; is a concept in social psychology.
It is the tendency for people to attribute behavior in others to *character* rather than to external factors.
It does not apply to how we judge our *own* behavior.
And possibly some of the behaviors of those very close to us in some situations.
But left unchecked it applies to our judgement of everyone else.</description>

I would probably forget to check.
I mean how do you even find out? Is it still on tv with the lady with the swimsuit and all?
After a couple days it would be all over the news.
I&amp;#39;d find out on Facebook that the winning ticket was purchased at the Circle K right by my house.

This will cost you about $600 million.
But your after tax winnings will be more than $600 million.
Except...
If someone else wins too you have to share.
And then you&amp;#39;d be out $300 million.
So don&amp;#39;t buy every ticket.

      <description>I got a little flack for leaving my oldest daughter, @imc, out of my daily life list. The truth is she&amp;rsquo;s in there. But not like in there, you know? I&amp;rsquo;m doing this in a public list so @ChrisK doesn&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;m a terrible father and because hey, I love to gush publicly about my amazing kids. 😊

      <description>So you&amp;rsquo;re refinancing your house, filling out college paperwork, signing a lease, starting a new job&amp;hellip;and they emailed you stuff to sign. Ugh, right? Print, sign, scan or photograph or fax. 😷 If you have a Mac, Apple has you covered. But sadly nobody seems to know it&amp;rsquo;s there. THAT&amp;rsquo;S WHERE I COME IN.
Start with a PDF.
Usually they will send you a PDF. If that&amp;#39;s the case just open it.</description>

The Giving Tree by Shel Silverstein
My first true love from before my clear memory begins. I still ❤️ it entirely so I don&amp;#39;t want to hear about all your negatives interpretations 😉.

      <description>So you&amp;rsquo;re making a veggie tray (or what I suppose @lisa_fav would call crudités) and you want everything even and pretty. You guys have probably always known this but I managed to go like 30 years before I figured it out.
Start with a pepper with a relatively uniform shape.
For an elegant veggie tray choose tall peppers if you can find them. This is a fat pepper so my sticks won&amp;#39;t be so great.</description>

I&amp;#39;ve never read his fiction but his biographies, his dictionary, and his histories are all smart and admirably concise.
Carson McCullers
A Member of the Wedding is the best in-the-head-of-a-child book I&amp;#39;ve read and The Heart is a Lonely Hunter is one of the best books I&amp;#39;ve ever read period.</description>

      <description>Be certain.
Nothing undermines courage like uncertainty. So if there&amp;#39;s any doubt, do your analysis and make sure you know you want to do this.
Be precise.
Know exactly what you want. Not vaguely. Not the minimum. Exactly what you want to do.
Be calm.
Remember to breathe. But not too fast. Count your breaths if you have to.
Take the first step.
Just the first step. The time for thinking ahead is over and now it&amp;#39;s time to focus on one step at a time.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve paid my dues.
1991: I bought a VHS copy in high school so I didn&amp;#39;t have to rent it anymore.
1992: My wife (then girlfriend) bought a VHS copy once I indoctrinated her.
These two lived side by side on the shelf when we got married.
2000: We bought it on DVD when we got a DVD player.
[2010: My DVD player died and I didn&amp;#39;t really want to deal with disks anymore anyway so I ripped a few of my favorite DVDs, including this one, and put them on my network backup drive.</description>

January: Reached my goal weight.
February: Made this awesome Lego wall hanging for my little friend.
March: Attended the funeral of my last living grandparent. At her house I snapped a picture of this picture of my beautiful mom and sister.
April: My girls surprised me with an awesome homemade dinner of carnitas tacos, fish tacos, pollo asado tacos, homemade salsas, and mangoes.</description>

Yay! Go ahead and go.
If you&amp;#39;re second.
Wait for the first person. Then you get to go!
If you&amp;#39;re third.
Wait for the first person. Then assert your dominance by rolling forward a few inches while the second person goes. Then you get to go!
If you&amp;#39;re fourth.
Wait for the first to go. Then the guy who is third will go in front of the guy who is second.</description>

      <description>My daughter @sophster calls this &amp;ldquo;special oatmeal&amp;rdquo; and it is one of her favorite foods. It is creamy, oaty, and has a silky texture.
Melt a couple tablespoons of butter in a pot on medium heat.
Add a cup of steel cut oats to the butter.
I assume this recipe won&amp;#39;t work well with rolled oats but I&amp;#39;ve never tried.
Toast the oats in the butter for a few minutes.</description>

Permian-Triassic Extinction Event ~ 252 million years ago
Otherwise known as the &amp;#34;Great Dying&amp;#34; this is the big one. Over some thousands of years, 96% of marine species and 75% of the terrestrial species went extinct. Evolution would require up to ten million years to re-establish previous levels of biodiversity.</description>

      <description>Pork Shoulder (sometimes called Pork Butt) is a great first-time &amp;ldquo;big&amp;rdquo; thing to smoke because it is delicious, special, and very forgiving. If you have a smoker or have access to one, this is easy, fun, delicious, and people will think you&amp;rsquo;re amazing 💅🏽
Get some meat
Lots of recipes and blogs claim a bone-in shoulder has better flavor. I once made three shoulders at once for a party and happened to have one bone-in and two boneless and I&amp;#39;m here to tell you it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter.</description>

      <description>&amp;#34;I arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve the world and a desire to enjoy the world. This makes it hard to plan the day.&amp;#34;
He wrote Charlotte&amp;#39;s Web
&amp;#34;What&amp;#39;s a life, anyway? We&amp;#39;re born, we live a little while, we die. A spider&amp;#39;s life can&amp;#39;t help being something of a mess, with all this trapping and eating of flies. By helping you, perhaps I was trying to lift up my life a trifle.</description>

      <description>An abridged list because I&amp;rsquo;m sure I would come up with five or six more if I tried.
Eddie Redmayne
This guy blows me away every time I see him. It is hard to believe one person can become so many things so perfectly. The best singer in Les Mis and the only good thing about Jupiter Rising. From the preview, his performance in The Danish Girl looks like it will be staggeringly good.</description>

      <description>Once when I was 13 or 14 a bird came down our chimney.
It was in the cold fireplace behind the closed glass doors.
The fireplace had a gas starter. You could turn a knob and flames would light the logs.
My father is a smart man. He finished premed in 3 years and had a long career as a very successful anesthesiologist, department chief, and hospital administrator.
But he&amp;#39;s not a smart man if you know what I mean.</description>

      <description>They are lovely. They remind me of the beautiful passage from Proust when as a grown man his mother offered him tea and a Madeline cookie and he sought to understand the pleasant feeling it elicited. The whole passage is beautiful but here&amp;rsquo;s the part about the recovered memories. Inspired by people inspired by @ChrisK.
And suddenly the memory revealed itself.
The taste was that of the little piece of madeleine which on Sunday mornings at Combray (because on those mornings I did not go out before mass), when I went to say good morning to her in her bedroom, my aunt Léonie used to give me, dipping it first in her own cup of tea or tisane.</description>

Sophia always asks for pineapple upside down cake.
So delicious and perfect for December.
Isabel (@imc) has a summer birthday and usually wants fresh berry tart with pastry cream.
Delicious AND beautiful. Her birthday is in July so we usually have a red/white/blue thing going on with blanched blueberries and strawberries or raspberries.
My wife is trickier. Her tastes vary. Sometimes pumpkin cheesecake. Sometimes flourless chocolate cake.</description>

      <description>This is Rosencrantz. He is five months old.
He has been running around the house like a madman since we brought him home 18 hours ago. He has jumped in my lap, over-consumed water and regurgitated it on the floor, and made a hilarious failed attempt at jumping up to the table. He occasionally overestimates the traction of the wood floor and I hear him skittling across the hall and into the wall.</description>

      <description>Interviewing a candidate at work with my coworkers makes me more nervous than interviewing for a job.
Way more. Being the interviewee doesn&amp;#39;t make me nervous at all but I stress so much about interviewing someone. I think this is just because I&amp;#39;m very confident in my profession but never claimed to be a competent interviewer.
Speaking in church before 150 people makes me more nervous than speaking in a conference in front of 1000 people.</description>

A reasonable guess of the number of atoms in the universe is around 4e79. That&amp;#39;s a very big number.
There are about a billion times more photons than atoms.
But the universe is big and this is hard to visualize.
I like to think of it this way…
Have you ever looked up at Saturn in the night sky?
It is a brilliant solid golden star, very beautiful.</description>

      <description>Inspired by @ChrisK
I want to be happy.
We are all of us lost sometimes, uncertain sometimes, and we try to have faith in something, whatever it may be, and hope our lives have meaning. But any true meaning is hard to come by. Whatever I think though, what always gives me the deepest happiness is to be a little less selfish for a time. Paradoxically, forgetting yourself and giving to someone else makes YOU feel better.</description>

      <description>This was a hard list request. I rethought my approach three times and I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure I&amp;rsquo;m making the case correctly. But here you go!
Because passionate interests are infectious.
Let your nerd flag fly because I love that you love the world so much and it makes me see things in a new way.
Because eventually the smiling and nodding comes to an end and it&amp;#39;s time to talk.</description>

      <description>The time in second grade when I just really wanted to kiss her and my teacher taught me about boundaries.
That time in fourth grade when Carrie said I was really funny and I fell madly in love with her because of it.
The time in fifth grade when Tiffany informed me we were going together for the day.
And I was expected to kiss her in the back field at recess.</description>

      <title>OBJECTIVE REASONS TO FIND GRITS GOOD</title>
      <link>http://gwcoffey.com/archive/listapp/objective-reasons-to-find-grits-good/</link>

      <guid>http://gwcoffey.com/archive/listapp/objective-reasons-to-find-grits-good/</guid>
      <description>Grits, like all grain-based hot cereals, are objectively good.
They are warm and comforting.
People objectively like comfort.
They are versatile.
Soft or firm, sweet or savory, creamy, fried, spicy, mild, cheesy…grits don&amp;#39;t care. People objectively like versatility.
They are a good friend to less outgoing foods.
I know what you&amp;#39;re thinking: smoked brisket is amazing. But it&amp;#39;s not the kind of thing to draw attention to itself. Grits can nestle up next to them and say &amp;#34;I&amp;#39;m here for you, and I won&amp;#39;t take away from you.</description>

Why does a wedding ring have a heart of stone?
Why does a little dog bury its bone?

      <description>Southwest: Yes! Bringing luggage is an implied aspect of travel so of course you can check bags. Some reasonable restrictions on size and quantity apply. Here let me take your bag!
American: Psh. Bags? Why do you need bags? Look, fine, maybe we can find some space somewhere in the hold idk. For $25 per bag I guess we&amp;#39;ll take them. Weirdo.
Southwest: We are very egalitarian here. Sit wherever you like!</description>

      <description>When Legolas dances with that troll guy. So elegant.
When Kate from Lost smirks like she knows it&amp;#39;s all a dream.
When the dragon isn&amp;#39;t Sean Connery.
How Bard kind of looks like Legolas from Pirates of the Carribean.
When the guy turns in to a bear and you&amp;#39;re like huh, I never would have guessed he would be a bear until all the hints.
When the physical comedy stops happening for a few seconds a every few hours.</description>

Cormac McCarthy&amp;#39;s spare punctuation around ornate sentences
The thread of narration in American Pastoral
It could be considered a spoiler I guess so I won&amp;#39;t say exactly what I mean but the way the narration is structured around this story is one of the most expertly executed things I&amp;#39;ve ever read.
Complex narration in Frankenstein
The poetic repetition of The Odyssey

&amp;#34;See how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them.&amp;#34;
One of my favorite lines of all and one I&amp;#39;ve deployed in many conversations.</description>

      <description>Zeno&amp;#39;s Tortoise Paradox
Hercules challenges a tortoise to a foot race. Seeing as he is Hercules he gives the tortoise a 100 yard head start. The race begins with the tortoise walking slowly and Hercules in an all out sprint. Soon Hercules has run 100 yards and reached the tortoise&amp;#39;s starting point. But by now the tortoise has walked ahead some. Hercules must now catch up to that point. When he does, obviously the tortoise has walked further still.</description>

      <description>You know the movie The Emperor&amp;rsquo;s New Groove? My girls loved the movie when they were little. I was talking to Sophie today (she&amp;rsquo;s 13 now) and she made these related confessions&amp;hellip;
First, she thought the man who &amp;#34;threw off the Emperor&amp;#39;s groove&amp;#34; in this scene was a woman.
Yeah I don&amp;#39;t know...
Second, in this scene she thought Pacha handed him his cell phone.
In 13th century Central America. That he then put on his foot.</description>

      <description>You can type anything into Google and it can show you all the web pages in the world that mention it ranked quite well by relevance. In milliseconds. From California.
There are little molecular machines in each of the billions of cells in your body unzipping your DNA, transcribing it, duplicating it, correcting errors, and stitching it back together again. Right now.
The act of opening this list caused an unimaginably long cascade of micro-instructions to be executed by a tiny solid state Turing machine inside your iPhone across hundreds of coordinated pieces of software.</description>

      <description>Before you start ask yourself, out of all the people in the world, how many are good enough? I don&amp;rsquo;t mean do calculus, or study statistics. I&amp;rsquo;m asking philosophically. What does it mean, fundamentally, if people—so far as we know the only things in the universe to which goodness really applies—aren&amp;rsquo;t mostly good enough for you? Now you&amp;rsquo;re ready…
Step 1: Forgive
There are exceptions of course. But for the most part you can simply let it go.</description>

      <description>This may be the dumbest nerdiest list I&amp;rsquo;ve ever made. It embarrasses me.
Fast Inverse Square Root ~ 0x5f3759df
The most magical of all magic numbers. Google if you&amp;#39;re curious but probably only if you&amp;#39;re also a programmer.
Avogadro&amp;#39;s Number ~ 6.02e23
Just an all around fascinating number. I mean really, heavy gas, light gas, doesn&amp;#39;t matter! It&amp;#39;s always the same. Surprising and cool. Of course now that I think about it, the fact that it is the same is probably what makes it possible for a gas to be &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; in the first place.</description>

      <description>❌ I have a thing for leather clad ladies on motorcycles.
I mean I do, but that&amp;#39;s not why I switched.
❌ I appreciate the frank directness of the new CEO
I&amp;#39;m from the generation that assumes their real straight talking CEO is the invention of a marketing team.
❌ Verizon&amp;#39;s customer support is terrible.
On the contrary, I&amp;#39;ve always found them to be polite, prompt and competent, which is everything I could possibly want from customer support.</description>

      <description>Inspired by https://li.st/l/ac3873c7-b418-4109-ae04-05a7d6f7e057 . I used to wonder why people cared about weather apps. Then I remembered you don&amp;rsquo;t all live here.
To see what kind of hot, sunny, and dry it will be today.
That&amp;#39;s all really.
I never use the weather app.
It is off in my second home screen along with Tips and that stupid frog game my daughter used to play.</description>

This is weird.
When *I* was a kid they played really old music.
Like I remember my mom saying &amp;#34;oh this was popular when I was in high school.&amp;#34;
Old stuff. From when my mom was in...

It is life altering: you can move the text insertion point around easily and precisely without your finger getting in the way of your view.
Press hard on the edge of the screen when swiping right from the edge
Many people know you can swipe right from the edge to go &amp;#34;back&amp;#34; in whatever app you&amp;#39;re in. (Try it now! It works in The List App.</description>

      <description>0-10 Years
Bike stunts gone wrong, jumping out of trees and off of swings, failed construction projects, building and floating custom &amp;#34;rafts&amp;#34;.
10-20 Years
Running injuries, crossing frozen creeks, attempting sports, fights.
20-30 Years
Unexpected falls from high places, rough housing with the kids, stress and lack of sleep.
30-40 Years
Relatively injury free.
40-50 Years
Only one year in to this but: doing laundry, lifting small objects, picking up a dropped item, attempting to scratch that spot on my back, washing my feet in the shower, sleeping in an imperfect bed…</description>

      <description>You would pluck out the heart of my mystery.
Love this angry line from Hamlet. We all deserve a little mystery.
When valor preys on reason it eats the sword it fights with.
Strange it is that nature must compel us to lament our most persisted deeds.
There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so.
The quality of mercy is not strained. It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath: it is twice blest; it blesseth him that gives and him that takes.</description>

Can you tease and insult them relentlessly and feel a little left out if they don&amp;#39;t tease you back? Have they called you lazy fat and stupid? Do they sometimes shake their head and say you are such a loser?
Well that just means you have a male acquaintance.</description>

His happy marriage
His second child
His third child

His complex involvement in his first child&amp;#39;s life from the time she was 8 on including visits, birthday parties, long walks, and trips together, and her incorporation into his family life with his wife and other children in her adulthood</description>

      <description>Examples of good things stripped of the inessential to reveal their truest value.
Caramel
The overt richness of butter and sugar freed from the conformist structures of flour-based baking.
Halloween
They unbridled joy of holiday celebration unburdened by moral imperative.
Raclette
Melted cheese by itself, which is all we really want, elevated from gaucherie by a French sounding name. Ooh la la so sophisticated!
The American Flag
Patriotic assertion of national pride unconflicted by … well … almost everything right now.</description>

      <description>I love a good romantic comedy but most of them aren&amp;rsquo;t very good. I&amp;rsquo;m no expert but to me this is how the genre family tree looks. Hop on the 400 year romantic comedy train.
Much Ado About Nothing ~ 1598
This play is ostensibly a retelling of a classic story of love and deception, but the Beatrice/Benedict &amp;#34;subplot&amp;#34; is, as far as we know, Shakespeare&amp;#39;s invention. And really it is the main plot: the one we are most invested in, the one into which Shakespeare puts his theatrical genius, and perhaps the original modern romantic comedy.</description>

      <description>Inspired by @hels, highly opinionated. Meant to be an open list with just a couple entries but I got carried away.
American Pastoral by Philip Roth
Roth is widely regarded as one of the great modern American novelists and this book is thoroughly engrossing and highly relevant to fractured American culture.
The Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank
It is impossible not to love this book. Funny, moving, intimate, and breathtakingly sad.</description>

      <description>This is a Roseate Spoonbill.
This is my dad today. Our story takes place many years ago. But now, as then, he is a man of great passions.
When I was 14 we took a trip to Sanibel Island in Florida. My sisters were in college so it was just mom, dad, my brother and I.
One day we decided to visit a nature preserve. We learned that it was a breeding ground for the endangered Roseate Spoonbill.</description>

Busted
Hey there she is back there!

I think she is amazing
And we could totally be best friends

But I have no way to tell her
Because List App has no direct messaging
I&amp;#39;d even consider unfollowing @sally and/or @mallofamanda to make her happy

Sorry Mrs. Kanull
For pulling over the cabinet and spilling its contents all over the floor.
Sorry Mrs. Art Techer
For giving you the middle finger through the window and then denying it when someone told on me.
Sorry Mrs. Gray
For pretending to drop my crayon and crawling around my desk like a dog.

      <description>Stand By Me Soundtrack
This was the first record I owned myself with my brand new record player so I could listen to what I wanted in my room.
U2 Joshua Tree
The first album I bought with my own money and one I listened to from about 12 years old right up to the present day. Still great.
Bob Dylan&amp;#39;s Greatest Hits
It&amp;#39;s a little embarrassing to put a &amp;#34;greatest hits&amp;#34; album on here but this was my intro to Dylan in high school which makes it a very big deal.</description>

It&amp;#39;s ok if I am. No hard feelings. But like there&amp;#39;s also someone named @olive that I can&amp;#39;t see at all so I assumed that is what happens when you&amp;#39;re blocked. I can see Maya&amp;#39;s lovely lists but I just don&amp;#39;t get a comment button.
Is there a setting that only allows comments from someone who follows you?
Maybe @maya has it set up that way?</description>

Breaking my foot by climbing up 15 feet in the air and then jumping down.
Broke my arm when I was two when I was swinging on a swing and flew off.
Jumping on the trampoline and I did a flip but I flipped right off and landed on my back and sprained my finger.</description>

The sun set cold in the north, a distant blue pebble in the otherwise featureless gray sky.
She blew into her hands and rubbed them together. Her skin was chapped and cracking.
- It won&amp;#39;t be much longer.
- I don&amp;#39;t suppose so.
- Not sure what time will mean anymore when we&amp;#39;re down there.

Wow, I&amp;#39;m glad I&amp;#39;m not hurt at all.
I should have said yes to the guy in the golf cart when he offered me a ride.
I should have brought water.
Eh, I could use the exercise.

If it is another name you recognize open the list.

      <description>This is something I do a lot of.
Identify an unsuspecting stranger.
Preferably someone who looks like they might be socially awkward or not interested in interaction.
Run to your target and exclaim &amp;#34;ARE YOU OK?!&amp;#34;
Ideally the person will look at you surprised and say nothing.
Spread your arms wide and demand the person be given &amp;#34;some space&amp;#34;.
Do this even if there is nobody around.
Put your shoulders back and say &amp;#34;don&amp;#39;t worry, I read about this on @wikiHow.</description>

      <description>#7 of my last minute sharing week dump. Inspired by @ChrisK
Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday.
I didn&amp;#39;t have to think about this. It always has been.
I love the sentiment.
A holiday devoted to thankfulness for the bounty of life is something that resonates with me a lot.
I love food.
Especially comfort food. And desserts.
I love cooking for my family.
I make thanksgiving dinner because it is like meditative joy for me.</description>

      <description>#6 of my last minute sharing week dump. Inspired by @ChrisK
I treat men and women differently.
I try not to but I do. I&amp;#39;m more inclined to drop what I&amp;#39;m doing and help a woman. This is probably patronizing and certainly rooted in inaccurate culturally-ingrained assumptions about capability and capacity to deal. I&amp;#39;m also more likely to talk to a woman, to open up to a woman, to have a sincere conversation with a woman, and to listen to a woman.</description>

      <description>#4 of my last minute sharing week dump. Inspired by @ChrisK
1978 Mesa Arizona
Because nothing would make me happier than seeing my wife as a toddler being adorable.
The very distant future
Because I want to know about our future, what becomes of us. Because it is more unknowable than the past. Because we will learn things in the next, say, 1,000 years and I&amp;#39;ll never know them and that makes me a little sad.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sure this is very inspiring for all you little people.
This Kurt Vonnegut finger puppet my daughter gave me a few years ago.
This stays magneted to my screen.
This &amp;#34;Isabel&amp;#39;s birthday star&amp;#34; craft thing my other daughter made for me years ago.
The brilliant star Sirius sometimes seems to flicker different colors, and one night when my girls were small we though it looked red, white, and blue. These are Isabel&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;birthday colors&amp;#34; because she was born on July 10 and always associated her birthday with US Independence Day.</description>

      <description>This is a very short list because Rice Krispy treats are near-perfect for what they are: The treat with the highest yum:easy ratio on earth.
50% more butter than the recipe says
My personal recipe is a stick of butter and one and a half bags of large marshmallows. This makes them softer and richer. If that half-bag annoys you like it does me then IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU NEED TO MAKE TWO BATCHES.</description>

      <description>etymonline.com 🔗 The Online Etymology Dictionary
I look stuff up here all the time because it is endlessly fascinating. Like just now I looked up &amp;#34;story&amp;#34; after reading @THEToughCookie&amp;#39;s list because I wondered why we call floors of a building a &amp;#34;story&amp;#34; and of course the answer was neat.
xkcd.com 🔗 xkcd
The only web comic I read (since Home Star Runner is no more). Definitely geeky, often geared toward programmers and engineers, occasionally over my head but almost always funny.</description>

      <description>Salt Lake City
I think 80 percent of Utahns have weapons buried in the back yard and stockpiles of food in the house. The state even has a giant granite mountain panic room. Add to that a population of Eagle Scouts and a wicked army of stay at home moms and you have, bar none, the safest place in the country if the world is overrun with ravaging bands of mindless monsters.</description>

      <description>Obligatory follow up to my previous list.
Hearing
For a year we thought I had &amp;#34;cookie bite syndrome&amp;#34; congenital hearing loss. Then it went away. It comes and goes and drives my poor wife crazy. What? What? Sorry, didn&amp;#39;t hear the phone ring. Didn&amp;#39;t hear the baby cry. I have a real doctor-verified case of selective hearing loss :)
Parties
Just read Quiet by Susan Cain if you care to understand.</description>

      <description>Dunno why. I just always get lucky.
Poison Ivy
This is what started this list. I got a case of poison ivy when I was maybe 8. Since then it has no effect on me. I can pull it, crush it, walk around in it and never get the slightest rash. Downside: I was Weeder-in-chief of the yard/forest border region when I was a kid. My parents used my power for their own purposes.</description>

Latex
Any medication
Bee stings
Tree nuts
Shellfish
Peanuts
Wheat
Please. I&amp;#39;d rather be dead.
Egg
Dairy
Soy
Gluten

Hibiscus
The one that started it all.
Biskybaby
My daughter Isabel weighs in with this one sometimes.
Bisky-bu-bums
My daughter Sophia calls her this all the time.

      <description>Assorted musings from my journal, shortened and reworded for consistency.
Sometimes when I count the people in the room so I can set the right number of places at the table, I forget to count myself.
Sometimes it seems hard to believe how my cat can hear me say &amp;#34;Get up&amp;#34; all the time and still not understand what it means.
Sometimes when I switch my bag from one shoulder to the other while talking on the phone, I am struck by the hundreds of intricate, coordinated, proprioceptive movements it takes to do it seamlessly, and I think for a moment that the body and brain are a miracle.</description>

Rather than fight crime he just annoys people constantly. Signature move: Sneaks up behind you and hisses in your ear. Gear: Malaria-misters on his wrists.
Incredible Hulk was hit with alpha radiation instead
Still just Bruce Banner but kind of has a temper anyway.
Baby Superman crashed in Moscow in 1972 instead

      <description>I love this underrated movie. It&amp;rsquo;s silly and a little weird but that&amp;rsquo;s because it is a fairy tale about capitalist greed subjugating the common man and distracting him with consumerism, which was ahead of its time for the &amp;rsquo;80s. Best of all it is funny and even a little touching and has Meg Ryan in three parts.
&amp;#34;What takes more courage? To twice traverse a staircase in flames or to make a one-time leap into the mouth of a smoking volcano?</description>

Fume Guy
This was the strangest and saddest addiction I&amp;#39;ve ever seen. An angry man huffing horrible noxious fumes from a big bottle of some kind of industrial aerosol. The smell of the chemical brought tears to my eyes and he was sucking on it like it was mother&amp;#39;s milk.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m kind of a jerk.
I&amp;#39;m sure this is all true.
This seems well thought out.
This is unlikely to backfire.
It looks like you&amp;#39;ve &amp;#34;done your own research.&amp;#34;
You handled that well.
I&amp;#39;m definitely up for that.
I&amp;#39;ll log that away.
Stolen from the vastly underrated Emperor&amp;#39;s New Groove which my children adored.
We should do this more often.
Great meeting guys.

Controversial I know. First, to heck with your controversy because this was my first biggest favorite thing way before I was aware enough to discern any problematic interpretation. I loved this book more than anything in the world from before I can remember. And second, to heck with your controversy because this book is lovely.</description>

      <description>I was a lousy speller as a kid. And it spilled over to an inability to sort out strangely spelled words. This is the story of my suffering.
Girl
I spelled this &amp;#34;gril&amp;#34; all throughout a book report I wrote in sixth grade about a book with an unnamed gril. I still believe that in a Midwestern accent this spelling more closely matches the pronunciation.
Schedule
In 4th grade my teacher had those cartoony classroom decorations and one of them had this word.</description>

      <description>Inspired by @originalamericantreat and @gabimoskowitz
Grateful Dead
My pop went to 55 dead shows from the 70s right up to their last show at Soldier Field in the mid 90s. He would often take a week or two off with my mom and hit New York, Pittsburg, Indy, and Chicago back to back. He took us to a few shows in Indy and one in North Carolina. I watched their reunion concert with him last month and he was in tears.</description>

      <description>This is a Buffy-fans-only list. Others please disregard.
&amp;#34;I&amp;#39;m sixteen years old. I don&amp;#39;t want to die.&amp;#34;
&amp;#34;Kick his ass.&amp;#34;
&amp;#34;Buffy?&amp;#34;
&amp;#34;I told him I loved him. Then I kissed him. Then I killed him.&amp;#34;
&amp;#34;We&amp;#39;re proud to say the class of &amp;#39;99 has the lowest mortality rate of any graduating class in Sunnydale history.&amp;#34;
&amp;#34;There&amp;#39;s a lot of stuff I&amp;#39;d like to do. I&amp;#39;d love to ice skate at Rockefeller Center.</description>

      <description>Girl can talk.
There are too many words coming out of the hole in your face.
Her favorite. She asked me to tell her teachers to use this one but I did not.
Sophia why don&amp;#39;t we play a game. I talk to mom and you don&amp;#39;t.
[when telemarketers call] Sophia, it&amp;#39;s for you!
I think the cat wants you to talk to her now.
You need to take a breather and so do my ears.</description>

      <description>This list is light on high end dining because I&amp;rsquo;m not a big partaker of fancy restaurants. Also it skews heavily toward stuff around my house. But everything on this list is 💯. I guarantee it.
Best Bread: Mediterra Bakehouse
Technically this is in Coolidge, not Phoenix, but you can find them at the public market on Saturday mornings and Wednesday afternoons and they have a few varieties at Whole Foods.</description>

      <description>Would prefer to stay home
Mammal
Fond of crunchy food
Covered entirely or partially with hair
Turns nose up to mushy foods from a can
Happy to hide in the back room when people come over
Can sleep anywhere and in any position
Not really that in to catnip
Prefer most things to unplanned doctor visits
Pretty tidy
Currently shedding a bit
Seriously guys, what&amp;#39;s up with my hair? Hairs everywhere.</description>

      <description>An exploration of the mundane, by request.
From my wife.
She&amp;#39;s informing me her flight home is really truly for real cancelled. I cried. Not really but you know, I was sad.
From my daughter Isabel.
She had just boarded a plane. Ha ha.
From my other daughter Sophia.
I&amp;#39;m actually super embarrassed for you all to see her terrible spelling and careless typing. This is basically how all her texts read.</description>

      <description>The Road Not Taken
This poem is about not following the crowd but instead striking out in our own direction and finding our true selves, right?! No. &amp;#34;Though as for that the passing there / Had worn them really about the same, / And both that morning equally lay / In leaves no step had trodden black.&amp;#34; It pointedly makes fun of our tendency to think past decisions are more important than they really are.</description>

      <description>Decent WiFi
The wifi at this crap hole always works reliably.
Spacious
There&amp;#39;s lots of room between tables and lots of nooks and crannies for semi-privacy.
Quiet
Everybody isn&amp;#39;t YELLING and the floors are carpeted and they use little proximity dealios so they don&amp;#39;t have to yell names.
Not crowded
Probably because the food is largely inedible its not super-jam-packed with people so I don&amp;#39;t feel bad sitting here for a couple hours.</description>

We could rent something!
SOPHIA: I think we should get out of the house!
Ooh. Jurassic Park has dinosaurs. Could be good?
SOPHIA: Yeah but it doesn&amp;#39;t start til 8.
We could see Mission Impossible! Let&amp;#39;s watch the preview for mission impossible!
SOPHIA: That does look good. ... I hate making decisions. How do I decide?
Well Minions has a Rotten tomato rating of 54%.</description>

&amp;#34;It was an adjunct failure.&amp;#34;
He meant abject.
&amp;#34;We need to support and abstain one another.&amp;#34;
He meant sustain.
&amp;#34;It conosotes something different.&amp;#34;
He meant connotes.
&amp;#34;Him and all his little dominions doing his bidding.&amp;#34;
He meant minions.
&amp;#34;I went to conjole her during this difficult time.&amp;#34;
He meant console.

      <description>The tv lists reminded me of my parents&amp;rsquo; penchant for taking me to movies I probably shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been at. I was the youngest and I think they just got tired of kid movies and, apparently, babysitters.
Age 4: Jaws
Scarred me for life.
Age 7: My Dinner with Andre
My friend was spending the night. When dad got home from work he said, &amp;#34;Want to go see a movie?&amp;#34; This is what we saw.</description>

Twin Peaks
I always had to go to bed before it was over. But I thought it was cool.

      <description>Sometimes the universe likes to troll.
The sun is 400 times larger than the moon and 400 times farther away.
Consequently they look like they&amp;#39;re the same size. They weren&amp;#39;t always this way and won&amp;#39;t always be. I imagine this messed with our understanding of the universe for a hundred thousand years or so.
The 18th century Titius-Bode law stated that planets tend to orbit twice as far away as the next planet in.</description>

It is a block from my house.
When I was a little boy and I visited my grandparents in small-town northern Indiana, my grandpa would always put on his seersucker pants and boater and walk to the barber with my brother and I.

      <description>Phoenix has a wonderful culture of mostly-Mexican-inspired urban murals. They are all over the city, often tucked away so you have to wander to find them. This list is long but it isn&amp;rsquo;t close to comprehensive. I didn&amp;rsquo;t do any South Phoenix, North Phoenix, or West Phoenix, or any of the surrounding cities. I&amp;rsquo;m sure they all have examples.

      <description>There are lots more Shakespeare movies but these are the ones I&amp;rsquo;ve seen recently enough to comment on.
The Hollow Crown from the BBC (All four plays in the first henriad)
Loki from Avengers plays an impeccable Henry V along with the always-awesome Jeremy Irons as Henry IV. I&amp;#39;m partial to the first in the series, Richard II but all four are fantastic. Very high quality and beautiful production. Weakest link: Falstaff, which is a shame because obviously he&amp;#39;s a big deal.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a little anti-social which might factor in to these. Please note: there&amp;rsquo;s no judgement here. I&amp;rsquo;m not suggesting these things are unworthy of time. I have great respect for our culture. I just don&amp;rsquo;t understand it sometimes or don&amp;rsquo;t feel a compulsion to engage. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why.
I&amp;#39;ve only watched one television show for its entire run in my life.
I&amp;#39;ve watched bits and pieces of lots of shows of course, but never had a show I really watched except Buffy.</description>

      <description>As you know, marriage was undermined last week. Here&amp;rsquo;s my diary of the aftermath in this lonely post-marriage outpost. I hope there&amp;rsquo;s somebody left to read this.
Day 1: The beginning of the end
Surprisingly my marriage is still intact. But my wife is traveling with spotty cell service so it is possible she hasn&amp;#39;t been able to get through to me to call it off.
Day 2: Churching
Went to church today.</description>

      <description>I love words. And I especially love words that came to us in interesting ways. Here are some of my favorites.
Bedlam
Bedlam, meaning a scene of uproar and confusion, comes from the 14th century British insane asylum called Bedlam Hospital, a colloquial pronunciation of Bethlehem Hospital, a place notorious for chaos and poverty.
Odyssey
You would be forgiven for thinking that The Odyssey is called The Odyssey because it is a story about a great odyssey.</description>

      <description>My future wife will be my present wife. We&amp;rsquo;ve been married almost 21 years and I see no reason to change. Here&amp;rsquo;re a few of the things I love about her.
She loved me at 17-18 when I was lost and confused and didn&amp;#39;t love myself.
It was the hardest time of my life and she made it bearable. Even beautiful at times.
She likes to not talk for a few minutes after an affecting movie and just let it settle in.</description>

Justice Kennedy is an eloquent supporter of gay rights and we&amp;#39;re lucky to have him.

Justice Roberts is a principled and articulate judge on the wrong side of this one.

      <description>Some of my favorites.
When Bill Murray whispers in Scarlett Johansen’s ear at the end of Lost in Translation
This is one of my favorite movies, and the ending couldn’t be more perfect. Two dissociated and alienated people make a meaningful connection that transcends language (the limits of which are thematic throughout the film) and now they must part. It is so fitting that the words they share in this final moment are not ours to hear, and would not mean anything to us if we did hear them.</description>

9 people in Charleston
The media and social media will obsess over these nine people for a few days.
Approximately 65 other people
If they were ever mentioned they&amp;#39;re already forgotten by everyone but their loved ones because they died individually instead of in a group.

      <description>A couple years ago my daughter&amp;rsquo;s teacher was pregnant. The teacher&amp;rsquo;s favorite book was Gatsby so Sophia decided to make her a soft baby-book version. She did the cutting and sewing. Her older sister and I did the textual adaptation. The result was arguably the coolest gift a kid has ever given a teacher.

      <description>There&amp;#39;s a difference between &amp;#34;it&amp;#39;s not my fault&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;I can&amp;#39;t help it.&amp;#34;
The former is common. The latter is rare.

&amp;#34;It made me mad&amp;#34; is never true and sometimes blame-shifting.

      <description>When Maia said goodbye
My daughter&amp;#39;s dear friend Maia moved to Taiwan last year. She was like an extra child around our house for a few years and we sincerely love her. When I said my last goodbye, which was already tough, she hugged me tightly, looked me square in the eyes and said, &amp;#34;you&amp;#39;re a really good dad.&amp;#34; [weep]

      <description>Cardboard milk cartons.
I had these under control when I was in kindergarten but now they&amp;#39;re an enigma.
The foil under the flap in a package of Trident gum.
Is it even perforated? Do I need a scalpel?
Glass bottles with twist off caps.
(Embarrassing)
Hotel doors.
Red light. Red light. Red light. Green light!
Conversations with my barber.
So um...any big plans for this...wednesday?

      <description>I got to see this movie the other day at an early screening. I honestly only went because I&amp;rsquo;m traveling alone and was bored and it was free. I watched the preview and thought &amp;ldquo;Meh, high school Juno-quirky comedy. Boring.&amp;rdquo; But I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I went because it was wonderful. I&amp;rsquo;m not a film buff at all but to my amateur eye the writing was superb.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been away from my family for a week and I&amp;rsquo;m getting surly. You probably shouldn&amp;rsquo;t read this indulgent judgmental BS.
Cranberries don&amp;#39;t belong on sandwiches.
This is what inspired this list. There should have been a large print warning in the menu.
Greens don&amp;#39;t belong on pizza.
Ever. EVER.
Leashes don&amp;#39;t belong on cats.
Or toddlers for that matter. Maybe there&amp;#39;s a rare scenario where this makes sense.
Phones don&amp;#39;t belong on dates.</description>

Being over charged, sold something you didn&amp;#39;t want, or humped by a dog do not meet the criteria of &amp;#34;rape&amp;#34;. Find another word.
Draconian
Is Facebook the government? Do they cut your hands off when you chew gum? No? Then their stupid policy isn&amp;#39;t &amp;#34;draconian&amp;#34;.

Jeneane Garofalo in The Truth About Cats and Dogs
Number one offender. The whole premise is that she&amp;#39;s ugly. Problem is she&amp;#39;s not ugly at all. She&amp;#39;s lovely.

From &amp;#34;Mexican Home&amp;#34;
&amp;#34;You know what blood looks like in a black and white video? Shadows. That&amp;#39;s what it looks like. All the love we shared between her and me was slammed, slammed up against the banks of Lake Marie.&amp;#34;

This incorrectly-installed towel hook looks like a buffalo.
He&amp;#39;s been that way for 10 years and I kind of love him.
This plaster smear looks like a camel&amp;#39;s head.
He watches me use the toilet. We talk sometimes.
This lamp shade fringe looks like raining ice cream cones with golden cherries.
Sometimes I think it looks like a blingy version of Space Invaders.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve known about Pluto since 1930 but it&amp;rsquo;s so small and far away that we don&amp;rsquo;t know much. Space probes have studied every planet in the solar system but we&amp;rsquo;ve never had a probe to Pluto. The New Horizons mission has its closest Pluto encounter on July 14. It will dramatically expand our understanding. Here&amp;rsquo;s how our view of Pluto has evolved.

Herman Melville put it best: &amp;#34;See how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them.&amp;#34; In the few cases where I&amp;#39;ve come to understand someone I judged harshly, I&amp;#39;ve always grown to love them.</description>

An archeologist.
Around age 8-10. Because of dinosaurs. Indianapolis Children&amp;#39;s Museum FTW.
An author.
Off and on from around 12 to 18. All through school I loved writing assignments and wanted to grow up to be a non-fiction writer.
An architect.
Around age 13. Not sure where this came from. Didn&amp;#39;t last long. I have no drawing skills whatsoever and very little interest in buildings.</description>

      <description>Hey I thought mentions in list titles would work. Hmm. Here? @ChrisK
A refrigerator has fallen on him and he can&amp;#39;t get to his phone.
He doesn&amp;#39;t really like me and I should go to bed early and cry.
He wants to be 100% sure he doesn&amp;#39;t have a date possibility first.
He&amp;#39;s too busy playing with the new script editor in FileMaker.
He&amp;#39;s too busy making and reading lists</description>

      <description>Well Sophie&amp;rsquo;s list was popular so now I feel like a jerk for favoring my wild spunky kid over her quiet delightful sister. At the risk of sounding like one of those insufferable parents, here&amp;rsquo;s what my other daughter is like. She&amp;rsquo;s her sister&amp;rsquo;s polar opposite, but equally awesome.
Literature
Here&amp;#39;re a few of the books on her shelf. Although I&amp;#39;m an ebook reader through and through, I love that she&amp;#39;s a paper book fetishist.</description>

I never liked this song until I heard Cash&amp;#39;s version. Now it moves me deeply. http://bit.ly/1GstLQy
Every Grain of Sand / Emmy Lou Harris
I loved the original but Emmy&amp;#39;s is more haunting. http://bit.ly/1GsBv54
Can&amp;#39;t Help Falling in Love / U2
Sublime take on an otherwise uninteresting song. http://bit.ly/1R9TsbL

I&amp;#39;ve begun to think there might be foods that &amp;#34;tear me up inside&amp;#34;.
I&amp;#39;ve decided my next car will be more comfortable.
Hairline.
I&amp;#39;m thinner than I&amp;#39;ve been in years and yet I&amp;#39;m not sure my pants are roomy enough.

      <description>Chocodiles
I hate twinkles but Chocodiles are kind of yummy.
Salsa Verde Doritos
The first one tastes so gross. The second one is like eh, not so bad. And then they become delicious. This effect lasts for about an hour.
Those rectangular ice cream sandwiches
If I think hard about them while eating they taste like plastic and butane. But if I distract myself they taste like heaven.

      <description>If you think Shakespeare is a little hard to understand you&amp;rsquo;re not alone! These are passages nobody understands. I love that given all that&amp;rsquo;s been written about Shakespeare, and his continuous popularity since he was alive, there can still be a little mystery.
Flim-flam the zim-zam?
Romeo and Juliet Act 2, Scene 5: “Scurvy knave, I am none of his flirt-gills, I am none of his skains-mates.”: Flirt-gills are apparently loose women, but nobody knows what skains-mates are.</description>

Lake Marie / John Prine
Perfect in the way only John Prine can be. Perfectly written and perfectly performed. http://bit.ly/1GrfnYJ
The Ballad of the Kingsmen / Todd Snider
Possibly the greatest rant-song ever written. http://bit.ly/1Grfy6n

      <description>Antony and Cleopatra may be my favorite play by Shakespeare, and not just because of all the funny innuendo. But here&amp;rsquo;s a list of the more obvious ones. For the middle school crowd + me.
When she was jealous of a horse.
Act 1, Scene 5: &amp;#34;Where think&amp;#39;st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he Or does he walk? or is he on his horse? O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!</description>

      <description>Some people say Cormac McCarthy is a pretensions poseur. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure this list will help but I love that he writes unapologetically in language relevant to the time, place, and circumstance of the story. Harold Bloom calls Blood Meridian one of the great American novels, equal to Moby Dick. It is well worth the time. Just bring a dictionary.

      <description>I love them all but here&amp;rsquo;s my attempt at a ranking.
Jupiter
Because it convinced us things don&amp;#39;t go around the earth.
Venus
Because it&amp;#39;s phases taught us more about the structure of the universe.
Saturn
Because it marked the extent man&amp;#39;s knowledge of the solar system for a hundred thousand years. And it is as beautiful in the sky as it is up close.
Pluto
Because I&amp;#39;ve been waiting anxiously for pictures of Pluto since I was 12 years old and we&amp;#39;re getting them THIS SUMMER.</description>

      <description>It took me way too many years to figure this out.
They look great.
LOOK AT THEM.
They taste the same.
Actually better because they have corners, which are the ambrosia of baked things.
It is way easier.
Really, just use a pizza wheel or a big knife.
You lose less to waste.
You still have to trim the edges before you cut or they won&amp;#39;t rise well but you keep all those perfectly usable in-between bits.</description>

Get bit by a rattle snake while out for a walk

Visit a new strip mall every week
Ride the light rail from one end to the other, and then get in your car and drive where you really need to go.</description>
