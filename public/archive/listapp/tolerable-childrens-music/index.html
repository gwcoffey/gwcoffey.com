<p>There&rsquo;s a period of time when your kids are little enough that you need some kid-friendly music to entertain them in the car. Unfortunately most children&rsquo;s music is insufferable. Here are some good albums.</p>
<ul class="listapp">

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Smithsonian Folkways Children&#39;s Music Collection / Various</p><p class="desc">This whole album is fun, beautiful, and historically significant. American folk music with a kid friendly focus. A mix of greats like Pete Seeger, Ella Jenkins, Jean Ritchie and Woody Guthrie. Also some foreign language goodies.</p></div><img class="popable" src="1.jpg"></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">For Our Children 10th Anniversary Edition / Various</p><p class="desc">I could sell this album with one sentence: Bob Dylan singing This Old Man. But it has so much more, including a gross-out song by Bruce Springsteen, Sting singing a 19th century British folk song, and a gorgeous Carole King&#39;s Child of Mine.</p></div><img class="popable" src="2.jpg"></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Not For Kids Only / Jerry Garcia and Dave Grisman</p><p class="desc">Two American greats riffing with children&#39;s music on guitar and banjo. It is fun-loving and delightful and occasionally moving.</p></div><img class="popable" src="3.jpg"></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">The Bottle Let Me Down - Songs For a Bumpy Wagon Ride / Various</p><p class="desc">Indie alt-country and rock take on children&#39;s classics and some fun surprises. Don&#39;t Wipe Your Face On Your Shirt is a family favorite but there&#39;s tons of good stuff here. Also this has the best title and cover of all.</p></div><img class="popable" src="4.jpg"></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Ella Jenkins / And One And Two</p><p class="desc">For the younger crowd this is like Barney music that doesn&#39;t make you want to pull your hair out. Ella Jenkins is so fantastic she can sing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star with a class of kindergarteners and keep you enraptured.</p></div><img class="popable" src="5.jpg"></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Night Time / Dan Zanes and Friends</p><p class="desc">All Dan Zanes and Friends albums are great but this was our favorite. Fun, funky jam band that&#39;s completely kid friendly.</p></div><img class="popable" src="6.jpg"></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">A Child&#39;s Celebration of Silliest Songs / Various</p><p class="desc">Chet Atkins singing I&#39;m My Own Grandpa is worth the price of admission alone but there are a few other gems on this album like Taj Mahal doing Beans and Cornbread, Little Richard&#39;s On Top of Spaghetti, and a wonderful Burl Ives riddle song. My kids loved this album when they were very small.</p></div><img class="popable" src="7.jpg"></div>
