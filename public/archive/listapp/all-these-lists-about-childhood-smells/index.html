<p>They are lovely. They remind me of the beautiful passage from Proust when as a grown man his mother offered him tea and a Madeline cookie and he sought to understand the pleasant feeling it elicited. The whole passage is beautiful but here&rsquo;s the part about the recovered memories. Inspired by people inspired by @ChrisK.</p>
<ul class="listapp">

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">And suddenly the memory revealed itself.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">The taste was that of the little piece of madeleine which on Sunday mornings at Combray (because on those mornings I did not go out before mass), when I went to say good morning to her in her bedroom, my aunt Léonie used to give me, dipping it first in her own cup of tea or tisane.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">The sight of the little madeleine had recalled nothing to my mind before I tasted it; perhaps because I had so often seen such things in the meantime, without tasting them, on the trays in pastry-cooks&#39; windows, that their image had dissociated itself from those Combray days to take its place among others more recent;</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">perhaps because of those memories, so long abandoned and put out of mind, nothing now survived, everything was scattered;</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">the shapes of things, including that of the little scallop-shell of pastry, so richly sensual under its severe, religious folds, were either obliterated or had been so long dormant as to have lost the power of expansion which would have allowed them to resume their place in my consciousness.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">But when from a long-distant past nothing subsists,</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">after the people are dead,</p></div></div>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">after the things are broken and scattered,</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">taste and smell alone, more fragile but more enduring, more unsubstantial, more persistent, more faithful, remain poised a long time,</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">like souls,</p></div></div>

   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">And as soon as I had recognized the taste of the piece of madeleine soaked in her decoction of lime-blossom which my aunt used to give me (although I did not yet know and must long postpone the discovery of why this memory made me so happy)…</p></div></div>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">immediately the old grey house upon the street, where her room was, rose up like a stage set to attach itself to the little pavilion opening on to the garden which had been built out behind it for my parents (the isolated segment which until that moment had been all that I could see);</p></div></div>
