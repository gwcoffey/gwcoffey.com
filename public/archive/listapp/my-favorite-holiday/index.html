   			<p class="item">I love cooking for my family.</p><p class="desc">I make thanksgiving dinner because it is like meditative joy for me. I&#39;m always exhausted when it&#39;s all done but also euphoric. I love that each member of my family has a personal favorite dish, and they&#39;re all different.
