   			<p class="item">America learned a lesson tonight. I think it is fair to say that Trump found a market for his populist appeal despite his hatefulness, and we who were so deeply opposed to his presidency should not ignore that. Many Trump supporters don’t trust their leaders to attend to their needs. That is real and important.</p></div></div>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">- It will cost those who struggle financially as tax policy shifts to favor the very wealthy at the expense of tremendous run up in the debt.</p></div></div>
