<p>Dunno why. I just always get lucky.</p>
<ul class="listapp">

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Poison Ivy</p><p class="desc">This is what started this list. I got a case of poison ivy when I was maybe 8. Since then it has no effect on me. I can pull it, crush it, walk around in it and never get the slightest rash. Downside: I was Weeder-in-chief of the yard/forest border region when I was a kid. My parents used my power for their own purposes.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Chicken pox</p><p class="desc">Like almost every pre-vaccine human I contracted chicken pox as a child. I had a single itchy sore on my tummy, just above my belly button. That&#39;s it. Then it went away. It was officially chicken pox though. Some people say this may actually be a problem and there&#39;s apparently a test I can take to be sure I have antibodies. I should probably do that.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Seasonal Allergies</p><p class="desc">I had seasonal allergies once. It was terrible. But it went away and never came back. My wife and daughters still have to Claritin up every spring but I don&#39;t. No idea why not.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Cold Season</p><p class="desc">My wife and kids get sick three times for every time I&#39;m sick, I&#39;m never sick more than a day, and my body conveniently only gets sick on the weekend and never when I&#39;m busy. I never have to miss work or other responsibilities.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Drug side effects</p><p class="desc">I always read all that side effect stuff about loss of appetite or muscle cramps or whatever and then I think, &#34;hmm, is it happening?!&#34; But it never is. I guess Dramamine makes me sleepy so maybe that counts.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Headaches</p><p class="desc">I guess I&#39;ve had a headache before. Like if I&#39;m way hungry or dehydrated. But it never hurts that much. I&#39;ve probably taken a pain killer twice in ten years.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Computer problems</p><p class="desc">I&#39;m one of those super-annoying people where the computer doesn&#39;t work right five times in a row and then you call me over and I push the same button you were pushing and suddenly it works fine. I think this is because the computer respects me.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Swine flu</p><p class="desc">I got the swine flu last year. Everybody around me who got it was sick for days. I was really sick but only for a day and a half and then I was fine.</p></div></div>
   </li>
