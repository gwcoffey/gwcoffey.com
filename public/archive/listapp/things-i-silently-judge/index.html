Some posts have been edited slightly to fix typographical errors and correctly represent the gender of some individuals. You can <a href="/archive/listapp/">view the full archive here</a>.

   			<p class="item">BMW drivers</p><p class="desc">I&#39;m sure that if I actually drove a BMW I would realize it is the Ultimate Driving Machine or whatever. But as a person who walks a lot I can assure you that there is a 75% chance that BMW is going to race the light and almost kill me when I&#39;m in the crosswalk. And a 0% chance the beater &#39;98 Honda Accord will do the same. Consequently I quietly judge all BMW drivers to be jerks with the exception of my aunt, who is a delight.</p></div></div>
