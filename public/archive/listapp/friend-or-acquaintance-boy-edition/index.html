<p>Inspired by @shanaz. I tried to do the boy version but I think I just ended up with the introverted jerk version instead. Anybody want to be my friend?</p>

   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Can you tease and insult them relentlessly and feel a little left out if they don&#39;t tease you back? Have they called you lazy fat and stupid? Do they sometimes shake their head and say you are such a loser?</p><p class="desc">Well that just means you have a male acquaintance. May not actually be a friend.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Can you stand to be around them?</p><p class="desc">Ooh! Your friendship is budding!</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Would you really rather stay in and read most of the time but for that one person it might be ok to go out now and again just please not too often?</p><p class="desc">Look at you you social butterfly!</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Would you much rather talk to them one on one over an ice cream or whatever than go to some party or other loud annoying venue and pretend you can hear for three hours while constantly checking your watch?</p><p class="desc">Sounds like you found yourself a buddy!</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Have you spoken to them about something other than work at least twice in the last six months?</p><p class="desc">Besties!</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Do they love Shakespeare too? No? Well are they at least ok talking about it and you&#39;re ok talking about football or Indian politics with them because it is interesting when they talk about it and you definitely love them?</p><p class="desc">Holy grail of closeness.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Do you like their kids maybe a little more than them?</p><p class="desc">Congratulations! You have graduated to deep life long friends.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Do you think it&#39;s a shame that in American culture you can&#39;t really tell them you love them on the regular but you do and you wish you could? And maybe even hold hands now and again like Indian young boys do?</p><p class="desc">This is what it feels like to be a boy with a real friend.</p></div></div>
