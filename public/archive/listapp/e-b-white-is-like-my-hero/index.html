A spider&#39;s life can&#39;t help being something of a mess, with all this trapping and eating of flies. By helping you, perhaps I was trying to lift up my life a trifle. Heaven knows anyone&#39;s life can stand a little of that.&#34;</p></div><img class="popable" src="2.png"></div>

   			<p class="item">He had a tremendous sense of humor.</p><p class="desc">He captioned this New Yorker comic, which is one of my all time favorites and I was so stoked when I learned he wrote it.

But I doubt she spends her entire life in Homer Zuckerman&#39;s barn cellar.&#34;</p></div><img class="popable" src="4.png"></div>

   			<p class="item">He was an impeccable writer.</p><p class="desc">&#34;The Elements of Style&#34; by Strunk and *White* right? Every word he ever wrote was clear and beautiful. He once said &#34;All writing is both a mask and an unveiling.&#34;</p></div><img class="popable" src="5.png"></div>

   			<p class="item">His approach was intricate and considered.</p><p class="desc">&#34;In writing of a spider, I did not make the spider adapt her ways to my scheme. I spent a year studying spiders before I ever started writing the book. In this, I think I found the key to the story.&#34;</p></div><img class="popable" src="8.png"></div>

   			<p class="item">He was consciously unselfconscious.</p><p class="desc">&#34;Bashfulness is a form of vanity, the only difference being that vanity is a tendency to overestimate your worth, and bashfulness to underestimate it; both arising from the overindulgence of self-consciousness.&#34;</p></div><img class="popable" src="9.png"></div>

   			<p class="item">He was deeply humanist.</p><p class="desc">&#34;When we slid the body into the grave, the loss we felt was not the loss of ham, but the loss of pig.
