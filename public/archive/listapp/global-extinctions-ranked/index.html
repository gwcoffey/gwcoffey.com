<p>Merry #draftmas. Not sure why I never published this one. I think I was trying to give it a theme or something and abandoned it.</p>

   			<p class="item">Permian-Triassic Extinction Event ~ 252 million years ago</p><p class="desc">Otherwise known as the &#34;Great Dying&#34; this is the big one. Over some thousands of years, 96% of marine species and 75% of the terrestrial species went extinct. Evolution would require up to ten million years to re-establish previous levels of biodiversity. This event is complicated and only partially understood, but can probably be attributed to run of bad luck including a major meteor impact, climate changes cause by volcanic activity, and changes in terrain due to continental drift.</p></div></div>

   			<p class="item">The Great Oxygenation Event ~ 2.3 billion years ago</p><p class="desc">Contrary to popular belief, life doesn&#39;t need oxygen. Early earth&#39;s atmosphere had none at all. Cyanobacteria, the earliest life, created oxygen as a byproduct of metabolism. Eventually this oxygen built up in the atmosphere with two major consequences: First, it was toxic to the anaerobic bacteria. Second, the conversion of atmospheric methane to carbon dioxide lead to a massive ice age. Combined, these almost killed off the Cyanobacteria entirely. They still exist today in very tiny numbers.</p></div></div>

   			<p class="item">The Holocene Extinction Event ~ Ongoing</p><p class="desc">Started around 15,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age. Humans are a major contributor to this extinction. Examples of extinctions include mammoths, the famous dodo, the passenger pigeon, and many plants.</p></div></div>
