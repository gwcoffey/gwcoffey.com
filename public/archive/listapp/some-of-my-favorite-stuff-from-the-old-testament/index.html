   			<p class="item">ü§î The cynical philosophy of Ecclesiastes ‚Äî I love this whole book from beginning to end, for all is vanity.</p><p class="desc">&#34;Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity. What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun? One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever. ‚Ä¶ All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again. All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.&#34;</p></div></div>

And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, &#39;Let there be light&#39;: and there was light. And God saw the light that it was good‚Ä¶&#34;</p></div></div>

And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them.&#34;</p></div></div>

(MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPSHARSIN.)</p><p class="desc">&#34;Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God‚Ä¶and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them. [Then] came forth fingers of a man‚Äôs hand, and wrote ‚Ä¶ upon the plaster of the wall of the king‚Äôs palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote. Then the king‚Äôs countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.&#34;</p></div></div>

When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not when they went. As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.&#34;</p></div></div>
