<p>Inspired by @hels, highly opinionated. Meant to be an open list with just a couple entries but I got carried away.</p>
<ul class="listapp">

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">American Pastoral by Philip Roth</p><p class="desc">Roth is widely regarded as one of the great modern American novelists and this book is thoroughly engrossing and highly relevant to fractured American culture.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">The Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank</p><p class="desc">It is impossible not to love this book. Funny, moving, intimate, and breathtakingly sad. It is a must read for all modern humans and difficult to put down once you start.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury</p><p class="desc">Short, intriguing, fast paced, and a little cranky.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Charlotte&#39;s Web by E.B. White</p><p class="desc">The classic children&#39;s lit entry on this list and one of the most beautiful books ever written.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">The Odyssey by Homer translated by Robert Fagles</p><p class="desc">This is a less-stuffy versified translation that makes the reading really fun. And of course this story, although it is ancient, could easily pass for a modern action film.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">All the Pretty Horses by Cormac McCarthy</p><p class="desc">McCarthy&#39;s masterpiece Blood Meridian is the real must read but it probably doesn&#39;t meet the &#34;easy to get in to&#34; requirement. So start here instead with this beautiful story of loss, love, and the vanished American west.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Catch-22 by Joseph Keller</p><p class="desc">I don&#39;t actually like this book much but it&#39;s an undisputed classic and an easy engaging read.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">My Antonia by Willa Cather</p><p class="desc">This early 20th century classic novel takes as its subject lower class immigrant girls which the National Endowment for the Arts called &#34;a radical aesthetic move.&#34; It is also a touching story that&#39;s easy to enjoy.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">The Heart is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers</p><p class="desc">This perennial entrant on &#34;best English language novels&#34; lists is staggeringly moving, beautifully written, and deeply humane. It is most remarkable to realize that McCullers was just 23 years old when it was published.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen</p><p class="desc">Not everyone&#39;s cup of tea but worth a shot. Despite its dated subject matter it is eminently readable and very funny. And Eliza Bennet is one of the truly great female leads in literature.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut</p><p class="desc">A short fast read that leaves you speechless. This is Vonnegut&#39;s masterpiece and a perfect example of his signature meta-fiction, dry humor, and deep humanity.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">The Feminine Mystique by Betty Friedan</p><p class="desc">Remarkable in part because of its historical significance and in part because of its modernity. You&#39;ll be amazed how well Friedan&#39;s characterization of feminism fits current thinking sixty years later, and a little disheartened at how long we&#39;ve known better.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald</p><p class="desc">If you didn&#39;t read this in high school you must read it soon. And if you did, it&#39;s worth another read later in life. Brilliant book plain and simple.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway</p><p class="desc">It&#39;s a Hemingway classic you can read in a day. What&#39;s not to like? And it is jam-packed with wisdom and beauty.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">True Grit by Charles Portis</p><p class="desc">Maybe not a classic but a gem of a book, with such a distinctive and appealing voice that you can&#39;t put it down. And of course it has a place in American culture by way of John Wayne.</p></div></div>
   </li>
