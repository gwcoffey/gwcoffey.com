<p>I love this underrated movie. It&rsquo;s silly and a little weird but that&rsquo;s because it is a fairy tale about capitalist greed subjugating the common man and distracting him with consumerism, which was ahead of its time for the &rsquo;80s. Best of all it is funny and even a little touching and has Meg Ryan in three parts.</p>
