<p>I should say that I have zero knowledge of the story outside the six films and I hate the prequels so much I basically pretend they don&rsquo;t exist.</p>

   			<p class="item">...</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">The Light Saber: Maz said it was Luke&#39;s and Vader&#39;s before that. So it must have been the one Obi Wan gave Luke in A New Hope, right?</p><p class="desc">The one that was lost forever (apparently not) on Bespin. How? Also, please tell me some creeper has Luke&#39;s shriveled hand in a reliquary somewhere too because that would be cool.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">On Rey&#39;s parentage: I absolutely don&#39;t buy it that she&#39;s the daughter of Han and Leia.</p><p class="desc">I can&#39;t imagine any scenario where that would play out given their deep guilt about Kylo and sending him away. After whatever unfolded they would have gone back for her. It&#39;s not like they couldn&#39;t make their way around the Galaxy.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">On Rey&#39;s Parentage: I also find it doubtful that she&#39;s Luke&#39;s daughter.</p><p class="desc">I don&#39;t know why but it doesn&#39;t seem right. I suppose though that there must be some connection. Hmm.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">On Rey&#39;s near-total defeat of Kylo: Either we&#39;re meant to think Kylo isn&#39;t as tough as he thinks he is, or Rey is crazy powerful, or this was a little sloppy.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">...When he tries to read her mind: This is a power we&#39;ve only seen powerful Sith use right?</p><p class="desc">And yet she blocks him when it matters. Something even Luke couldn&#39;t do when fighting Vader in ROTJ after he was fully trained.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">...Kylo seems to have serious self control problems. See, for example, slashing up everything in sight when he&#39;s mad.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">...Kylo apparently has not taken the title of Darth. Is he not there yet, or is that not always a thing?</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">...Kylo is basically trounced by an untrained Jedi in a light saber battle.</p><p class="desc">Granted she was already a seasoned fighter as shown on Jaaku. And it seems she was losing before she found the courage to call upon the force in the fight.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">...Kylo clearly has allegiance issues. Does this undermine him?</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">...On the other hand, Kylo can read minds very effectively. Palpatine could do this. Vader could but apparently only a little bit.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">...And he can &#34;freeze&#34; people. Is this a new thing?</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">...And he can hold a laser blast in mid air until he stops thinking about it.</p><p class="desc">Definitely a new thing.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">On the Rey side...</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">...She is definitely resourceful and strong and we see hints of force capabilities early on.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">...And she&#39;s a heck of a pilot. Perhaps the best &#34;using the force&#34; pilot we&#39;ve ever seen.</p><p class="desc">See Millennium Falcon battle with Tie Fighter early on.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">...And her light saber vision.</p><p class="desc">I saw the movie with my wife and two kids and we all remembered completely different things from this sequence. Is this just the first on-screen representation of what a Jedi sees, eg when Luke sees Han being tortured in the future on Bespin? Or is this something different?</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Thoughts?</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Who was the guy who knew Kylo in the beginning (Max von Sydo)? We&#39;re we meant to be curious?</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">My kids claim they saw Kylo&#39;s thugs in Rey&#39;s vision when she was a small child. I missed it but remember hearing a voice reminiscent of Kylo.</p><p class="desc">Did Kylo have something to do with Rey&#39;s back story?</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">My 2 cents on Han&#39;s inevitable death: He had to die because this is Rey and Finn&#39;s story and Han is way too big and charismatic a character to keep around. He steals the show.</p><p class="desc">Harold Bloom says this is why Mercutio had to die in Romeo and Juliet and I think it fits here too. Han steals the show every time he&#39;s on screen and this isn&#39;t his story anymore. Bye bye.</p></div></div>
