   			<p class="item">The sun is 400 times larger than the moon and 400 times farther away.</p><p class="desc">Consequently they look like they&#39;re the same size. They weren&#39;t always this way and won&#39;t always be. I imagine this messed with our understanding of the universe for a hundred thousand years or so.</p></div></div>

   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">The 18th century Titius-Bode law stated that planets tend to orbit twice as far away as the next planet in. This was roughly true for Mercury through Saturn (the then-known planets) and correctly predicted the existence of the large asteroid Ceres and of Uranus, both discovered after the law was proposed.</p><p class="desc">But it fell apart with Neptune and Pluto and is in fact just a funny coincidence.</p></div></div>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Clyde Tombaugh, discoverer of Pluto, was searching that area of the sky expecting to find a planet because observations of Neptune&#39;s orbit suggested there was something big there.</p><p class="desc">The math was based on totally incorrect data. But there happened to be a planet there anyway. A very tiny planet far smaller than predicted. But we didn&#39;t figure that out for years.</p></div></div>

   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">At precisely the time we were technically capable of building effective space probes, the four outer planets lined up for us.</p><p class="desc">This alignment made Voyager 2&#39;s so called Grand Tour possible and exploded our understanding of the solar system. The last time it happened we hadn&#39;t invented the train. It won&#39;t happen again until 2150ish.</p></div></div>

   			<p class="item">Three years after the first Star Wars gave us the iconic Death Star space station (small moon?), Voyager 1 gave us our first look at this small moon of Saturn.</p><p class="desc">That&#39;s no moon. Wait, yes it is. It&#39;s Saturn&#39;s tiny moon Mimas.</p></div><img class="popable" src="6.png"></div>
