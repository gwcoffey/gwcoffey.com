<p>The tv lists reminded me of my parents&rsquo; penchant for taking me to movies I probably shouldn&rsquo;t have been at. I was the youngest and I think they just got tired of kid movies and, apparently, babysitters.</p>

   			<p class="item">Age 7: My Dinner with Andre</p><p class="desc">My friend was spending the night. When dad got home from work he said, &#34;Want to go see a movie?&#34; This is what we saw. My friend never let me live it down.</p></div></div>

   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Age 8: Poltergeist</p><p class="desc">Our piano teacher said it was the scariest movie he&#39;d ever seen and I thought, &#34;I&#39;m never going to that!&#34; 24 hours later there I was in line. This movie ripped open the scar left by Jaws, and then maggots came pouring out of it.</p></div></div>

   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Age 10: The Fly</p><p class="desc">It is possible that by this point in my life I was so easily spooked that this relatively tame movie seemed scarier than it was. But at one point I&#39;m fairly certain Jeff Goldblum vomits digestive fluid on someone&#39;s hand dissolving it to the bone. Gross.</p></div></div>

   			<p class="item">Age 13: Blaze</p><p class="desc">I&#39;ll let you decide if this is appropriate for a 13 year old. I certainly liked all the boobies. There were many others like this. This is just the one I remember most ... vividly.</p></div></div>
