<p>Etgar Keret is an Israeli short story writer I adore. His work is fast, moving, tight, beautiful, satirical, surreal and explosive. Here is one of his tiny stories. You should buy his book.

   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">There’s a theory that says there are billions of other universes, parallel to the one we live in, and that each of them is slightly different.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">There are the ones where you were never born, and the ones where you wouldn’t want to be born.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">There are some parallel universes where I’m having sex with a horse, and ones where I win the lottery.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">There are universes where I’m lying on the bedroom floor, slowly bleeding to death, and universes where I’ve been elected president, by a landslide.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">But I don’t care about any of those parallel universes now. The only ones that interest me are the ones where she isn’t happily married, with a cute little boy, the ones where she’s completely alone.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">There are plenty of universes like that, I’m sure.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">I’m trying to think about them now.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>

   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Among all those universes, there are some where we’ve never met. I don’t care about those now.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Among the ones that are left, there are some where she doesn’t want me. She tells me no. In some of them, she does it gently, and in others—in a way that hurts.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">I don’t care about those now, either.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">All that’s left are the ones where she tells me yes, and I choose one of them, a little like you choose a piece of fruit at the greengrocer’s. I choose the nicest one, the ripest one, the sweetest one.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">It’s a universe where the weather is perfect, never too hot or too cold, and we live there in a little cottage in the woods. She works at the city library, a forty-minute drive from our home, and I work in the education department of the regional council, in the building that faces hers.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Sometimes, from my office window, I can see her putting books back on the shelf. We always have our lunch together. And I love her and she loves me.</p></div></div>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">And I love her and she loves me.</p></div></div>

   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">I’d give anything to move to that universe.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">But meanwhile, until I find the way there, all I can do is think about it. I picture myself living there, in the middle of the woods. With her, in complete happiness.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">There’s an infinite number of parallel universes in the world. In one of them, I’m having sex with a horse; in another, I win the lottery.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">I don’t want to think about those now, only about that one, the one with the cottage in the woods.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">There’s a universe where I’m lying with my wrists slashed, bleeding, on the bedroom floor.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">That’s the universe I’m doomed to live in until it’s over.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">I don’t want to think about it now. I just want to think about that other universe. A cottage in the woods, the sun setting, going to bed early.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">In bed, my right arm is unslashed, and dry. She’s lying on it and we’re hugging each other. She lies on it for so long that I can hardly feel it anymore. But I don’t move, I like it that way, with my arm under her warm body, and I keep liking it even when I can no longer feel my arm at all.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">I can sense her breathing on my face—rhythmic, regular, unending.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">My eyes begin to shut.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Not just in that universe, in bed, in the woods, but in the other universes too, the ones that I don’t want to think about.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">I enjoy knowing there’s one place, in the heart of the woods,</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">where I’m falling asleep happy.</p></div></div>
