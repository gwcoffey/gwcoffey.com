<ul class="listapp">

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">I treat men and women differently.</p><p class="desc">I try not to but I do. I&#39;m more inclined to drop what I&#39;m doing and help a woman. This is probably patronizing and certainly rooted in inaccurate culturally-ingrained assumptions about capability and capacity to deal. I&#39;m also more likely to talk to a woman, to open up to a woman, to have a sincere conversation with a woman, and to listen to a woman. I&#39;ve had way more female than male friends most of my life. Men confuse me more.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">I suck at impulse control.</p><p class="desc">I love sweets. I stay up late. I get distracted. I snap at my children. I feel a little road rage.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">I take the people who love me for granted.</p><p class="desc">I make a conscious effort not to but my inclination is to forget, to not make time, to not want to talk when it&#39;s expected, to not notice the little things.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">I have to make up for lack of focus by working faster.</p><p class="desc">If I weren&#39;t lucky to be fast at what I do I&#39;d be a poor employee because I lose focus and work inefficiently a lot. Especially when I have periodic interruptions.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">I am uncompetitive to a fault.</p><p class="desc">I don&#39;t like to win. I feel bad when I win. I don&#39;t like to argue. I don&#39;t like to disagree. I don&#39;t like to make someone see the flaw in their thinking. I don&#39;t ask for more and I settle for less a lot. I say yes too much.</p></div></div>
