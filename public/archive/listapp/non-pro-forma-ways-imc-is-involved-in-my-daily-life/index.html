<p>I got a little flack for leaving my oldest daughter, @imc, out of my daily life list. The truth is she&rsquo;s in there. But not like in there, you know? I&rsquo;m doing this in a public list so @ChrisK doesn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m a terrible father and because hey, I love to gush publicly about my amazing kids. üòä</p>

   			<p class="item">&#34;The sun&#39;s going down and the moon is just holding its breath.&#34;</p><p class="desc">For 17 years you have been a huge source of light in our home. While you continue to shine you increasingly do so in other places and in other ways. You&#39;re building a life of your own and soon it will rise. It will be different. You won&#39;t be here but we&#39;ll see that light reflected by the connection of experience we have and will continue to share. And let&#39;s be honest: the sun is brilliant but the moon is more beautiful.</p></div></div>

   			<p class="item">&#34;Sail on silver girl, sail on by. Your time has come to shine. All your dreams are on their way. See how they shine! And when you need a friend I&#39;m sailing right behind.&#34;</p><p class="desc">Every day I think about you. And recently those thoughts are about the waters ahead. How do I help you without directing you? You&#39;ll have troubles for sure, because life is trouble sometimes. But you have always been so introspective, so self aware, and so driven to be good that I know rationally the best thing for me to do is stay out of the way. Even if that is hard sometimes.</p></div></div>

And it is stuck to my monitor so I see it every day.</p></div></div>

I&#39;m sure you have secrets but I was always afraid to tell my parents anything real and some kids just don&#39;t want to. You are honest with us even when you think what you&#39;ll say is not what we want to hear and that is amazing and deeply admirable.</p></div></div>
