   			<p class="item">Fair disclosure: I&#39;m not really a fan of the original. I genuinely don&#39;t get why it is so popular. I was really young when I first saw it though so maybe that tainted me.</p><p class="desc">I have tried twice to re-watch it as an adult but got bored and turned it off both times. None of this is a dig at the movie itself. Lots of people I admire love this movie like a child.</p></div></div>

   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Anyway my number one response to the new one is: That&#39;s it? What&#39;s all the fuss about?</p><p class="desc">I assumed there *must* be some heavy handed &#34;man bashing&#34; in there somewhere to rile so many people up but there wasn&#39;t at all. Confused.</p></div></div>

   			<p class="item">It wasn&#39;t like the greatest movie I&#39;ve ever seen or anything but..</p></div></div>

   			<p class="item">It was very very very funny. I laughed out loud a lot. So did @mamiecoffey. And @sophster loved loved loved it.</p></div></div>

   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">I&#39;m a huge Kristin Wiig fan anyway so I&#39;ll watch her in anything. She was impeccable as always.</p></div></div>

   			<p class="item">This Kate McKinnon person stole the show. She&#39;s ridiculously funny.</p><p class="desc">&#34;How about something stationary. Like a bullseye?&#34; &#34;The president is a plant!&#34; I&#39;m still laughing.</p></div></div>

   	<div class="container">

   			<p class="item">For all the crap on line about Leslie Jones being a caricature or whatever...I dunno. I thought she was hilarious and her character was multi-dimensional and integral.</p><p class="desc">She was probably the easiest to identify with, responding to the crazy stuff like a normal person.</p></div></div>

   			<p class="item">I&#39;ve always been lukewarm on Melissa McCarthy but she was great here.</p><p class="desc">I loved her in St. Vincent, but most of her movies are very much not my thing.</p></div></div>

   			<p class="item">Chris Hemsworth should do comedy more. Way more likable as a hilarious dope than a stodgy dope.</p></div></div>
