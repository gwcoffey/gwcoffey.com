<p>I&rsquo;m going to make some lists about lyrics I love. I&rsquo;ll start with R.E.M. which was my first lyric love way back in middle school. You kids today don&rsquo;t know what it was like back then listening over and over with headphones and a pen and paper trying to work out the words so you can process them. R.E.M. was the first to put me through that.</p>

   			<p class="item">Find the River - http://youtu.be/l0RCmOF1ACU (This is arguably their most beautiful and esoteric song and the whole thing could go on this list,  but here&#39;s the end.)</p><p class="desc">The river to the ocean goes / a fortune for the undertow. / None of this is going my way. / There is nothing left to throw / of ginger, lemon, indigo, / coriander stem and rows of hay. / Strength and courage override / the privìleged and weary eyes / of river poet search naïveté. / Pick up here and chase the ride / the river empties to the tide. / All of this is coming your way.</p></div></div>

   			<p class="item">Blue - (Their best last line for sure, gave the album it&#39;s title. This whole song is an incredible testament to place and time.)</p><p class="desc">I want Whitman proud / Patti Lee proud / My brothers proud / My sisters proud / I want me / I want it all / I want sensational / Irresistible / This is my time and I am thrilled to be alive / Living / Blessèd / I understand / Twentieth century collapse into now.</p></div></div>

   			<p class="item">It Happened Today - http://youtu.be/6mV1H8e2CgM (This line always cracks me up.)</p><p class="desc">This is not a parable. / This is a terrible / this is a terrible thing. / Yes I will rhyme that after / after all I&#39;ve done today. / I have earned my wings.</p></div></div>

   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Nightswimming - https://youtu.be/ahJ6Kh8klM4 (Their second most beautiful song, to me it is basically a deeply moving and far more nuanced version of Frozen&#39;s Let It Go.)</p><p class="desc">I forgot my shirt at the water&#39;s edge / the moon is low tonight / Nightswimming deserves a quiet night / I&#39;m not sure all these people understand / It&#39;s not like years ago / the fear of getting caught / of recklessness and water / they cannot see me naked / these things, they go away / replaced by everyday.</p></div></div>

   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Belong - https://youtu.be/Ag6EGdYhuuQ</p><p class="desc">She began to breathe / To breathe / At the thought of this freedom / Stood and whispered / To her child / Belong / She held the child and whispered / With calm / Calm / Belong</p></div></div>

   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Half a World Away (1) - http://youtu.be/AWiBIrPMEWk</p><p class="desc">The lonely deep sit hollow (?) / Half a world / Half the world away / My shoes are gone / My life spent / I had too much to drink / I didn&#39;t think / I didn&#39;t think of you / I guess that&#39;s all I needed / To go it alone.</p></div></div>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Half a World Away (2) - (I&#39;m a sucker for strange and beautiful imagery.)</p><p class="desc">The storm it came up strong / It shook the trees / And blew away our fear.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">World Leader Pretend - https://youtu.be/YoQ4aR393Is (Old R.E.M. when they had less imagery and more precise lyrical complexity. This was the &#34;new&#34; R.E.M. when I discovered them as a middle schooler.)</p><p class="desc">I&#39;ve a rich understanding of my finest defenses / I proclaim that claims are left unstated / I demand a rematch / I decree a stalemate / I divine my deeper motives / I recognise the weapons / I&#39;ve practised them well / I fitted them myself.</p></div></div>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Fall on Me - http://youtu.be/5ldjy_yRLio (Classic 80s political alternative.)</p><p class="desc">There&#39;s the progress we have found / A way to talk around the problem / Building towered foresight Isn&#39;t anything at all / Buy the sky and sell the sky and bleed the sky and tell the sky / Don&#39;t fall on me / Fall on me.</p></div></div>

   			<p class="item">Leaving New York - https://youtu.be/OEwI3yKMxkI</p><p class="desc">You might have laughed if I told you / You might have hidden the frown / You might have succeeded in changing me / I might have been turned around / It&#39;s easier to leave than to be left behind / Leaving was never my proud / Leaving New York never easy / I saw the light fading out.</p></div></div>

   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Oh my Heart - https://youtu.be/eN1f4AFgiAc</p><p class="desc">It&#39;s sweet and it&#39;s sad and it&#39;s true / how it doesn&#39;t look bitter on you. / Oh my heart / Oh my heart / Oh my heart.</p></div></div>
