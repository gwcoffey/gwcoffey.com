<p>Obligatory follow up to my previous list.</p>
<ul class="listapp">

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Hearing</p><p class="desc">For a year we thought I had &#34;cookie bite syndrome&#34; congenital hearing loss. Then it went away. It comes and goes and drives my poor wife crazy. What? What? Sorry, didn&#39;t hear the phone ring. Didn&#39;t hear the baby cry. I have a real doctor-verified case of selective hearing loss :)</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Parties</p><p class="desc">Just read Quiet by Susan Cain if you care to understand. I go with my wife because she&#39;s a social butterfly but I limit it to a few a year and I dread it all day.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Travel</p><p class="desc">I&#39;m a homebody. I love &#34;being&#34; places but I don&#39;t love getting there, sleeping there, showering there, and being away from my happy place for too long.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Phone calls</p><p class="desc">I used to get nervous every time I talked on the phone to the point that my heart would race and I&#39;d get out of breath. Weird I know. It&#39;s much better now but I still don&#39;t like it. Partly because I can&#39;t hear well and partly because I need visual cues to read people.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Medical procedures</p><p class="desc">No I don&#39;t have high blood pressure. I just have so called &#34;white coat syndrome&#34;. When I was a kid I would pass out every time I had blood work done. Then one day when my dad was making fun of me about it for the tenth time I described how it feels and he said &#34;well that&#39;s just because you&#39;re hyperventilating.&#34; Ever since I just pay close attention to my breathing and I&#39;m fine.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Fashion/style</p><p class="desc">Oh my gosh I don&#39;t get it. I have no idea what looks good. It makes me so self conscious I just avoid anything flashy. Although I do think you all look great. I love @ChrisK&#39;s stripy socks. So cute. But I would never wear them because I&#39;d be sure I&#39;m doing it wrong.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Focus</p><p class="desc">ADD is my blessing and my curse. I honestly wouldn&#39;t wish it away but I&#39;m terrible at paying attention to some things, especially auditory input.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Sweets</p><p class="desc">There&#39;s a box of dark chocolate caramels in my cupboard and I ate like 10 of them yesterday. I am weak.</p></div></div>
