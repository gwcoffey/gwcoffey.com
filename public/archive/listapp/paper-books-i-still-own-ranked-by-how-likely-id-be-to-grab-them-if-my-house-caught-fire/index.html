<p>I got my first kindle maybe 5 or 6 years ago and began buying mostly eBooks. Then I started replacing my paper books with eBooks and slowly got rid of them all. Here are the ones I kept.</p>
<ol class="listapp">

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">The Where the Sidewalk Ends my wife (@mamiecoffey) gave me when our first child (@imc) was born. Complete with beautiful inscription.</p></div><img class="popable" src="1.jpg"></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">My original childhood Giving Tree.</p></div><img class="popable" src="2.jpg"></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">My very beat up signed Hocus Pocus by Kurt Vonnegut.</p><p class="desc">My mom took me to see him speak in Indianapolis when I was in high school and then when I was too shy to go ask for a signature, she insisted.</p></div><img class="popable" src="3.jpg"></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">This special edition Giving Tree my wife gave me.</p><p class="desc">I also own the eBook Giving Tree because sometimes you just need a quick read while you&#39;re away from home.</p></div><img class="popable" src="4.jpg"></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">The Oh, the Places You&#39;ll Go! my mother gave me when I graduated from high school.</p><p class="desc">Cliche? Yes. Special to me? Yes.</p></div><img class="popable" src="5.jpg"></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Diary of a Dead Man by John Chessman</p><p class="desc">Maybe this is on the lowdown but John Chessman is @ChrisK. He was experimenting with print-on-demand services and self publishing and put this book he wrote in high school up there just to see how the layout, printing, and purchasing process worked. I of course immediately bought it before he was done testing and took it down. I think he was kind of annoyed.</p></div><img class="popable" src="9.jpg"></div>
   </li>
