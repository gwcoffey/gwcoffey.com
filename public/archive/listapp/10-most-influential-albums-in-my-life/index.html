   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Stand By Me Soundtrack</p><p class="desc">This was the first record I owned myself with my brand new record player so I could listen to what I wanted in my room.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">U2 Joshua Tree</p><p class="desc">The first album I bought with my own money and one I listened to from about 12 years old right up to the present day. Still great.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Bob Dylan&#39;s Greatest Hits</p><p class="desc">It&#39;s a little embarrassing to put a &#34;greatest hits&#34; album on here but this was my intro to Dylan in high school which makes it a very big deal.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Red Hot &#43; Blue: A Tribute to Cole Porter to Benefit AIDS Research</p><p class="desc">This album is both awesome, and served as my introduction to The Neville Brothers, David Byrne, Tom Waits, and to a lesser extent Iggy Pop. Tom Waits in particular would go on to be one of my top lifetime favorites.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Tom Waits: Big Time</p><p class="desc">My first Tom Waits purchase after hearing him on Red Hot &#43; Blue. I went on to buy basically everything he ever made. And again I&#39;ve been a fan from high school up to today. It never gets old. He may be the best musician on earth imho :)</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">John Prine Anthology: Great Days</p><p class="desc">Another greatest hits of sorts. I stole this two disc set from my dad when I was 16 and John Prine has been a major source of enjoyment for me ever since. I love everything about his music.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Emmy Lou Harris: Wrecking Ball</p><p class="desc">This is a near perfect album of Emmy Lou Harris&#39; hauntingly beautiful music. And the one that made me realize I&#39;m a huge fan of anything Daniel Lanois produces. It also has the best version of Dylan&#39;s Every Grain of Sand.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Guns N&#39; Roses: Use Your Illusion</p><p class="desc">I liked this in high school and then put it away. Only on the last few years have I resurfaced it. It is fantastic.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Kris Kristofferson: The Silver Tongued Devil and I</p><p class="desc">I fell in love with this album on a family road trip while we drove through Sedona when I was 13 and I think it heavily influenced my musical tastes. Also, it is a crazy good album. The song The Pilgrim makes me feel like crying every time.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Les Miserables: Original Broadway Cast Recording</p><p class="desc">I&#39;m a sucker for musicals and I love the novel so I got hooked on this sound track about 15 years ago. From my contentious claim that Eponine&#39;s voice is beautiful to my schoolboy friend Braden Danner as Gavroche to my little daughters always asking me to sing A Little Fall of Rain at bedtime, this album will always be special to me.</p></div></div>
