   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">I don&#39;t actually judge women exclusively by their sex appeal. I was just making a point about misogyny. You hysterical bimbos blew it all out of proportion.</p></div></div>

   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">I didn&#39;t mean to imply your mama is so fat she took a bath in the pacific and caused the 2004 tsunami. I know your fat mom had nothing to do with it.</p></div></div>

   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">I recently implied that race influences heroic status. That was not my intent. Even non-white people can do good things sometimes as long as they&#39;re not Mexicans or Muslims.</p></div></div>

   			<p class="item">Ok so my daughter tells me some illegal immigrants are actually kind of cool. The media has portrayed my recent comments as a racial attack on Mexicans. I think Mexicans are great. I have a lot of Mexican housekeepers.</p></div></div>

   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">There&#39;s a vicious rumor going around that I implied people from Mexico are only suited to unskilled labor. This is not true. Being a housekeeper requires a lot of skill: gold polishing, diamond polishing, discretion, etc...</p></div></div>

   	<div class="container">
