<p>I was a lousy speller as a kid. And it spilled over to an inability to sort out strangely spelled words. This is the story of my suffering.</p>
<ul class="listapp">

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Girl</p><p class="desc">I spelled this &#34;gril&#34; all throughout a book report I wrote in sixth grade about a book with an unnamed gril. I still believe that in a Midwestern accent this spelling more closely matches the pronunciation.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Schedule</p><p class="desc">In 4th grade my teacher had those cartoony classroom decorations and one of them had this word. I spent all year trying to sort out what it spelled. It was a year or two later before I realized that&#39;s how you spell &#34;schedule&#34;.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Coed Naked Lacrosse</p><p class="desc">A girl at camp had this on a T-shirt. I was pretty sure I knew vaguely what Lacrosse was, but I thought those first two words were one syllable each: code nake&#39;d lacrosse.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Jewelry</p><p class="desc">I remember sitting at my desk for ten minutes trying to figure out how to spell this word (Google didn&#39;t always exist, kiddos). In my defense, we Hoosiers pronounce it &#34;jew-luh-ree&#34; which is not at all how it&#39;s spelled.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">POW*MIA</p><p class="desc">I would see these window stickers on the backs of cars and I decided it must be a summer camp of some kind: Pow-me-uh. Yeah, sounds like a summer camp.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Till</p><p class="desc">Till is a contracted &#34;until&#34; so it obviously only has one L right? Well it turns out if you spell it that way several times in a big company wide email at work you will get teased.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Subtlety</p><p class="desc">This word is such a spelling hot mess I just avoid ever typing it. Because those letters up there clearly spell sub-tu-letty.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Tomorrow</p><p class="desc">When I was a kid my uncle told me, &#34;just remember Tom or Row!&#34; and for some crazy reason it worked. I&#39;ve never had trouble since.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Coathanger</p><p class="desc">In my defense, my iPhone says that isn&#39;t even a word so maybe I was actually right all those years ago when I read it as &#34;coath-anger&#34; and my dad laughed and laughed.</p></div></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Condemn</p><p class="desc">Note to 7th graders reading aloud in class: not pronounced like condom.</p></div></div>
   </li>
