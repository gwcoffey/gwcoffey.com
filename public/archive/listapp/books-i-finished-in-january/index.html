   			<p class="item">RESTful Java with JAX-RS 2.0 by Bull Burke</p><p class="desc">I&#39;ve been doing REST APIs in Rails for several years and I did oodles of Java web work back on the heady days of servlets and that fancy new &#34;struts&#34; but I&#39;m new to JAX-RS so I burned through this book a couple weeks ago. Good solid book and really impressive framework.</p></div><img class="popable" src="1.jpg"></div>

   			<p class="item">Designing Data Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann</p><p class="desc">I&#39;m not sure I can claim to have finished this because it is one of the O&#39;Reilly early access books meaning the author&#39;s not done writing it yet. But I read the first seven chapters which is where it currently stops. This is a very good book that surveys the landscape and puts a lot into perspective.</p></div><img class="popable" src="2.jpg"></div>

   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Programming Scala by Dean Wampler and Alex Paybe</p><p class="desc">I only read parts of this and skimmed the rest. Not sure how interested I am but it was recommended. I&#39;ll give it a thorough read soon-ish.</p></div><img class="popable" src="3.jpg"></div>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">The complete developer documentation for Redis 3.0 and Redis Cluster</p><p class="desc">Reading docs is always dry but I&#39;m mildly obsessed with reading every word for any software I start using seriously so I forced my way through it. I&#39;ll probably re-read most of it in a few weeks.</p></div><img class="popable" src="4.jpg"></div>

   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Evening in the Palace of Reason by James Gains</p><p class="desc">Started this last month, will finish this week. It would break my fathers heart to hear me say this, but I find the parts about Frederick the Great way more interesting than the parts about Bach but all of it is pretty great.</p></div><img class="popable" src="5.jpg"></div>
