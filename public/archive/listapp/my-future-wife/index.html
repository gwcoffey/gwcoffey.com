<p>My future wife will be my present wife. We&rsquo;ve been married almost 21 years and I see no reason to change. Here&rsquo;re a few of the things I love about her.</p>
<ul class="listapp">

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">She loved me at 17-18 when I was lost and confused and didn&#39;t love myself.</p><p class="desc">It was the hardest time of my life and she made it bearable. Even beautiful at times.</p></div><img class="popable" src="1.png"></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">She likes to not talk for a few minutes after an affecting movie and just let it settle in.</p><p class="desc">Those silent moments side by side are golden.</p></div><img class="popable" src="2.png"></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">She is such a clever mom she makes it look effortless.</p><p class="desc">It is always after the fact that I realize she had been executing a complex year long plan to build independence and confidence and suddenly my 17 year old is comfortable booking a flight, flying alone, catching the shuttle, staying in a hotel alone, and finding her way to the college tour. And then I say, &#34;Oh is this why you did that whole public transit scavenger hunt for her 16th birthday?!&#34; And she smiles knowingly and pats my arm.</p></div><img class="popable" src="3.png"></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">She&#39;s super-creative.</p><p class="desc">She makes pillow cases for everyone, she made a quilt for our bed, she documents our lives in elaborate scrapbooks that boggle my mind, she makes baby books for friend&#39;s babies, she turns glass jars into beautiful center pieces for the school &#34;senior night&#34;, she makes a skirt out of neckties, she alters clothes, SHE MADE THESE DRESSES...</p></div><img class="popable" src="4.png"></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">She is passionate about helping people.</p><p class="desc">As a stay at home mom she volunteered constantly. Girl Scouts, school gardening and art programs, making meals for home bound people, driving seniors to the doctorâ€¦ When she went back to work it was right into serving the least-fortunate people in our community. Right now she&#39;s in Indiana helping a friend road trip her three small kids to a family reunion in Michigan because the friend&#39;s husband died suddenly last fall and the mom wasn&#39;t sure she could handle it herself. That&#39;s how she is.</p></div><img class="popable" src="5.png"></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">She loves road trips.</p><p class="desc">I do not love road trips. But that&#39;s ok. She and my girls took a huge multi-week road trip every summer for years and I would join them somewhere for a week or two. She took them all over the country, and in to Canada and Mexico a little bit. So many moms say &#34;aren&#39;t you nervous to travel with the kids by yourself&#34;. She is gracious in reply and I chuckle. My wife nervous? LOL.</p></div><img class="popable" src="6.png"></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">She has managed to keep a close open relationship with our 17 year old girl.</p><p class="desc">Everything I&#39;ve read says this is a miracle. Isabel talks to her mom about absolutely everything. When the topic is particularly sensitive or potentially embarrassing they talk via texting instead and my wife&#39;s a-ok with that. They aren&#39;t always happy with each other but they are amazingly close.</p></div><img class="popable" src="7.png"></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">She&#39;s ridiculously organized and effective when it&#39;s time to get it done.</p><p class="desc">We&#39;re doing a few minor fixups to our house getting ready to sell. I was prepared to put too much money into it because who had the time to figure it all out? But her internship ended and she came home and *poof* it is almost done, twice as nice as I had hoped, and cost less than half what I was expecting. Because she&#39;s meticulous and organized.</p></div><img class="popable" src="8.png"></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">Most of her friends are old ladies.</p><p class="desc">I don&#39;t know why I love this but I do. Her best friend is Janet, 71. She&#39;s got oodles of close friends in their sixties and seventies. She says they are kinder to and more supportive of each other and don&#39;t talk about babies and periods all the time.</p></div><img class="popable" src="9.png"></div>
   </li>

   <li>
   	<div class="container">
   		<div class="text">
   			<p class="item">LOOK HOW CUTE SHE IS</p><p class="desc">With her funny hat.</p></div><img class="popable" src="10.png"></div>
   </li>
