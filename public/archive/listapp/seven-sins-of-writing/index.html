   			<p class="item">Sentimental ~ This is unearned emotion. If you tell me she&#39;s devastated, if you tell me her voice cracks, if you show me her tears, none of that matters if any of it had to be said.</p><p class="desc">&#34;Like great works, deep feelings always mean more than they are conscious of saying.&#34; — Albert Camus</p></div></div>

   			<p class="item">Contrived ~ This is unearned circumstance. He can&#39;t just think very hard or be especially earnest to make his weakness disappear. To overcome has to come from somewhere. Maybe I never saw it coming but when it does it should feel inevitable.</p><p class="desc">&#34;You can&#39;t hit the magic note without going through the scales.&#34; — Jim Crace</p></div></div>

   			<p class="item">Invulnerable ~ This is unearned resilience. It doesn&#39;t have to be mortal peril. It doesn&#39;t have to be a cost I myself would ever have to pay. But she has to suffer and I have to believe it would really matter to her in the universe you&#39;ve constructed.</p><p class="desc">&#34;The dark does not destroy the light, it defines it.&#34; — Brené Brown</p></div></div>

   			<p class="item">Inauthentic ~ This is unearned character. No matter how strange the universe, characters, and circumstances, the emotional context must be real, and his response to it must be authentic.</p><p class="desc">&#34;All truth is a shadow…But every truth is substance in its own place, though it be but shadow in another place. And the shadow is a true shadow, as the substance is a true substance.&#34; — Isaac Pennington</p></div></div>
