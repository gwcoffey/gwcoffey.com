<h1 id="isabel-photosite">Isabel Photosite</h1>
<p>This was my first &ldquo;personal&rdquo; site. In 1998 when Isabel was born, I built a small site to share baby photos with family around the country. This of course predates things like Facebook, Instagram, etcâ€¦ The photos are tiny and low quality because we were all using dialup at the time. This was a fun personal project that gave me a chance to demonstrate to family members what I did for a living.</p>
<p>The site was originally hosted at <code>http://coffey.nu/isa</code>. The web server was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSTAR">WebSTAR</a>, an HTTP server for classic Mac OS that supported an AppleScript ACGI interface. Pages were dynamically generated in AppleScript on the server side using data stored in a FileMaker Pro database. Internet hosting was provided by <a href="https://amug.org">AMUG, the Arizona Macintosh Users Group</a>.</p>
<p>While I could add new photo <em>metadata</em> via the web interface, I had to upload the photos themselves manually using FTP. File upload was added to the HTML spec a year earlier in HTML 3.2, but I didn&rsquo;t yet know how to use it. Instead I ran the <a href="https://www.maxum.com/Rumpus/">Rumpus</a> FTP server for classic Mac OS so I could copy files directly to the server.</p>
<p>This archive is a static copy based on the original templates and data. (And as such the admin functions to manage and post photos no longer work.)</p>
