<h1 id="maclane-bot-on-mastodon">MacLane Bot on Mastodon</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of the <a href="https://botsin.space/@mobydick">Moby Dick at Sea</a> Mastodon bot. And I&rsquo;m a big fan of the 20th century&rsquo;s first and biggest bad girl, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_MacLane">Mary MacLane</a>. <em>And</em> I&rsquo;m a computer programmer. So I suppose this was inevitableâ€¦</p>
<iframe src="https://botsin.space/@maclane/109657266831978744/embed" class="mastodon-embed" style="max-width: 100%; border: 0; width: 100%;" width="400" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><script src="https://botsin.space/embed.js" async="async"></script>
<p>I give you, the <strong><a href="https://botsin.space/@maclane">Mary MacLane Bot</a></strong> on Mastodon, a bot that posts random curated passages from Mary MacLane&rsquo;s <em>I Await the Devil&rsquo;s Coming</em> every two hours.</p>
<h2 id="who-is-mary-maclane">Who is Mary MacLane</h2>
<p>Mary MacLane&rsquo;s writing is hard to classify, but I&rsquo;ll try: self-absorbed, honest, irreverent, hyper-dramatic, funny, sad, beautiful, and personal. She wrote her debut memoir, <em>I Await the Devil&rsquo;s Coming</em>, as a sort of diary over a period of three months in 1901, at just 19 years old. It begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I of womankind and of nineteen years, will now begin to set down as full and frank a Portrayal as I am able of myself, Mary MacLane, for whom the world contains not a parallel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It then it just <em>goes</em>.</p>
<p>She came to me late in life. I&rsquo;m not sure how I discovered her work, but the moment I did, maybe five years ago, I was hooked. (My kids will tell you this is unsurprising because I have something of a fascination with so-called &ldquo;badly behaved women&rdquo; and Mary certainly fills that niche.)</p>
<p>I think the thing I love most about her writing is that it pulls no punches. In some sense she&rsquo;s the quintessential teenager, for whom everything is somehow simultaneously overwhelming and entirely possible.</p>
<p>I love her pleading prose. I love her dry humor. I love her strangeness in all its forms.  Some people are turned off by her ego. Some by her irreverence. Some by her dramatics. (And some, of course because she&rsquo;s bisexual.) But I love her. I love her not in spite of these things but because of them.</p>
<p>As Mary says in her entry on <time datetime="1901-04-13">April 13</time>, <q>I have given my heart into the keeping of this.</q> And now <em>I</em> give it to <em>you</em>.</p>
<h2 id="technical-details">Technical Details</h2>
<p>The bot is implemented in <em><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a></em>. The <a href="https://github.com/gwcoffey/litbot">source code</a> is available on GitHub, and the bot is available as an NPM module called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gwcoffey/litbot">@gwcoffey/litbot</a>. This is a somewhat generic module for selecting at random from a dataset of text passages and posting it to Mastodon.</p>
<p>I curated the data for MacLane Bot myself using the plain text version of <em>I Await the Devil&rsquo;s Coming</em> from <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43696">Project Gutenberg</a>. I am, as always, grateful for the Project Gutenberg volunteers for the valuable work they do.</p>
<aside class="note">
Note: Note: The Project Gutenberg version of the book carries the title <em>The Story of Mary MacLane</em>. This is the original publication title because Mary&rsquo;s preferred title was considered too provocative.
</aside>
<p>MacLane Bot itself is executed periodically as a <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/functions/scheduled-functions/">Netlify scheduled function</a>. The code for the function and the raw passage data is in the GitHub repo for this website but I&rsquo;m not going to link to it here&mdash;it is so much more fun to follow the bot and get little jolts of joy throughout the day.</p>
<p>The MacLane Bot Mastodon account is graciously hosted free of charge on the <a href="https://botsin.space/">botsin.space</a> instance.</p>
