Let me start by saying: “Ouch.” It has been far, far, far too long since our last article. Someone much wiser than me once said something like this: “My only comfort is that I tried. My only regret is that I failed.” I’ll leave it at that.

In short order, I’ll be posting our first new article in over 18 months. But first I thought I’d share a little news. For those who are here for great FileMaker info, feel free to skip ahead. (And let’s be honest, that’s the only reason *any* of you are here.)

As many of you have noticed, my name is not on the cover of *FileMaker Pro 11: The Missing Manual*. Since I know a lot of people will ask, here’s the scoop:

I love O’Reilly and we had (have?) a fantastic relationship. I still remember the first O’Reilly book I ever read (The Camel Book), and the awe I felt at its immense quality. It was absolutely an honor to work with a company whose product I respect so much.

It should go without saying, but I love my former co-author, Susan Prosser, who has been a professional associate and personal friend for years. I loved working on the book. The process was hectic, and aggravating, and fun, and wonderful in a million ways.

But writing a book is a labor of love. If you add up all the late nights and killer deadlines and huge work, and divide by the modest revenues, it’s a tough sell. I always considered it worth it because (here comes the honesty) it helped my reputation, helped me sell my services, and was a bit of a thrill. But the calculus has shifted a little. I don’t know how much the book does those things anymore. So when it came time to fire up Microsoft Word (barf) and start in on a revision for 11, I realized I couldn’t justify the stress and life-disruption this time around. This was a personal decision on my part.

In the beginning, I wrote the never-publised *FileMaker Pro 7, The Missing Manual* over months of long nights. Susan later saved my bacon by revising my manuscript for FileMaker 8 so it could see the light of day. I then had the opportunity to work on revisions for 9 and 10 with Susan. In all, we wrote or revised approaching 3,000 pages, over a thousand screen shots and figures, and a dozen screen casts.

After all that, I would be remiss if I didn’t say this: *Thank you*.

Thank you to **Vince Menanno** who convinced me to pursue the project in the first place. Thank you to **Tim O’Reilly** who blew my mind when he responded personally to the inquiry placed on the O’Reilly web side. Thank you to **Susan Prosser** who literally saved the book from failure, and made later revisions a joy. Thank you to **Stuart Gripman** of Crooked Arm Consulting who ably picked up the reins for FileMaker 11. Thank you to my first editor, **David Pogue**—I will never forget the validation I felt as an aspiring writer when he encouraged me along. Thank you to **Nan Barber**, my editor, who made the book much better than it otherwise could have been. Thank you to my wife **Mamie** and my children, **Isabel** and **Sophia**, who surrendered a husband and father to the computer for a few months every couple of years. And thank you to everyone who read the book, which may include **you**. (Especially those of you who left positive feedback on Amazon.com :wink:).

I'm full of mixed emotions right now. On the one hand it is a relief to watch a new FileMaker release roll out and not be on a deadline. On the other hand, it's a little sad. In some ways I miss the crunch, and especially the deep-dive into the minutia of a new release.

Ok, I’m done with all that now. Back to regularly scheduled (Ha!) programming.
