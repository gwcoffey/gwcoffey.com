# Six Fried Rice Archive 

I ran [Six Fried Rice][sfr], a software consulting firm, with Jesse Antunes from 2007 to 2015. In the early days I was writing books for O'Reilly and used the site as a professional blogging platform to promote our business and the books to the FileMaker Pro community of developers.

I sold my share of Six Fried Rice to Jesse when I decided to take a job with [Apple][apple] and he still runs the company today (albeit with no real blogging presence anymore.)

The site (built on WordPress) is still up but the old posts are suffering from bitrot. I cleaned up and archived all the articles I wrote for safe keeping here.
