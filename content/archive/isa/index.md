This was my first "personal" site. In 1998 when Isabel was born, I built a small site to share baby photos with family around the country. This of course predates things like Facebook, Instagram, etcâ€¦ The photos are tiny and low quality because we were all using dialup at the time. This was a fun personal project that gave me a chance to demonstrate to family members what I did for a living.

The site was originally hosted at `http://coffey.nu/isa`. The web server was [WebSTAR][webstar], an HTTP server for classic Mac OS that supported an AppleScript ACGI interface. Pages were dynamically generated in AppleScript on the server side using data stored in a FileMaker Pro database. Internet hosting was provided by [AMUG, the Arizona Macintosh Users Group][amug].

While I could add new photo *metadata* via the web interface, I had to upload the photos themselves manually using FTP. File upload was added to the HTML spec a year earlier in HTML 3.2, but I didn't yet know how to use it. Instead I ran the [Rumpus][rumpus] FTP server for classic Mac OS so I could copy files directly to the server.

This archive is a static copy based on the original templates and data. (And as such the admin functions to manage and post photos no longer work.)
