   {{< listapp/item title="When I was 14 we took a trip to Sanibel Island in Florida. My sisters were in college so it was just mom, dad, my brother and I." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="One day we decided to visit a nature preserve. We learned that it was a breeding ground for the endangered Roseate Spoonbill." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="There were signs about the spoonbill. They explained that this majestic animal was threatened because it's breeding area was dwindling." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="They explained that this preserve was one of the few places left in the United States for these birds to nest." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="They explained that the Roseate Spoonbill was a rare natural treasure." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="As we rounded a corner in the park we came to a small bank on the inlet. There were three spoonbills standing at a distance in the still water."

   {{< listapp/item title="It was silent. My father was moved by the scene." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="\"Boys, boys look\" he said. I don't know if his eyes were welling with tears but I like to think they were." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="We stood on the sandy bank and admired the birds." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Dad knelt between us, put his arms around our shoulders." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="\"This is a special moment\" he said. \"These beautiful birds are endangered. Their numbers are dwindling.\"" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="He squeezed us close as we watched together. \"The day is not far off that they may be gone forever.\"" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="And then he said with great reverence: \"You will never see this many Roseate Spoonbills at the same time for the rest of your lives.\"" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="We watched the three lonely spoonbills for a second more. But only a second." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Because we were distracted by a strange sound in the distance. It grew louder." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="It became a cacophony." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="And then from behind the trees far across the water a great dark mass rose up." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="The noise grew deafening." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="The sky grew dark." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Thousands of Roseate Spoonbills filled the sky." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="They filled our field of view, drowned out the silence, and settled in their great abundance on the trees, on the bank, and in the water. Everywhere a spoonbill could fit, a spoonbill was seen."
