This is an ill-formed set of primordial thoughts demanding deeper understanding on my part. Stuff I've been thinking about a lot.

{{< listapp/list order=false reverse=false >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Assumption #1: We elect presidents and making that selection should be democratic."
      desc="(It isn't terribly democratic right now given our electoral system and I'm still on the fence about pros/cons of that but that's a different list.)" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Assumption #2: We don't elect candidates. Anybody can run for president if they meet the constitutional requirements. There's no obvious constitutional right to democratically select who runs." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Assumption #3: The Republican primary system is overall a little more \"democratic\" than the Democrats'."
      desc="Fewer caucuses, no super delegates, more winner take all which favors popular favorites over underdogs." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Assumption #4: The republican primaries have promoted poor candidates for several cycles and this year actually selected an unqualified bad candidate."
      desc="The party ticket is topped by a non-republican who's positions don't align well with the party, who the party doesn't want, and who is an embarrassment to the party." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Contentious Assumption #5: Bernie Sanders was a strong second in the Democratic primary as an outsider who arguably would be bad for the party."
      desc="I like a lot about Bernie but he definitely isn't an insider the party can trust to fall in line to further its interests nation-wide over the long run and up and down the ticket." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Contentious Assumption #6: The major parties serve an important role organizing voters, defining packaged platforms, running grassroots campaigns, fostering candidates at every level, and bringing organization and funding infrastructure to the whole process." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Contentious Assumption #7: Our non-parliamentary executive branch is designed in such a way that a multi-party system would be dangerous. The two party system is the only thing potentially stopping a Trump presidency. And a president elected with 10% of the popular vote has the same exact constitutional power as one elected with 90% of the vote"
      desc="I used to be a big \"third parties!\" person but on reflection, I think it's a terrible idea. And ultimately I think any party would anger any person in some ways any time it has broad appeal. Only highly factional divisive parties can appeal to all their supporters in every way." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="[Correction: Of course a heavily divided multiparty election would be unlikely to award a majority of electoral votes to any candidate in which case the House of Representatives would choose the winner. You can't win the presidency with 10% of the popular vote. I had forgotten this when I wrote the above.]"
      desc="But the point still stands: not a system well suited to multiple parties." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Background: Historically the parties chose their own candidates as they saw fit. This resulted in instances of insider corruption. The current democratization of the primary process is a result of the McGovern-Fraser Commission of 1972."
      desc="[Link](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGovernâ€“Fraser_Commission)" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Concession #1: It isn't really a fair characterization to say the parties are \"private organizations\" and leave it at that. Given our strong two party system, it is reasonable to at least consider a regulatory infrastructure that encourages transparency in the nominating process." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Contentious Concession #2: The undemocratic structure of the Democratic primary system actually helped Sanders more than it hurt him. Delegate splitting and caucuses both worked to his advantage."
      desc="If it had been more \"democratic\" he would have been out much earlier. Undemocratic caucuses heavily favored Sanders and delegate splitting in general favors the second place candidate because of rounding." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Question #1: What is the justification for open primaries?"
      desc="Full disclosure: I'm not a member of any political party. Recently (last 4-6 years maybe) I've begun to consider joining a party and being involved in it locally. I'm now pretty sure I will. But as an outsider, I have always refrained from voting in the primaries on philosophical grounds. I'm not a participating party member so why should I have a say in who the party runs? I get my say in the election." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Question #2: Does a more democratic primary process undermine the ability for the parties to run effective high quality candidates?" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Question #3: Historiclly, what kinds of corruption lead to the McGovern-Fraser Commission and did the reformed system fix those problems?" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Question #4: Does the reformed system directly lead to or contribute to promoting lower quality candidates?"
      desc="At all levels, not just just for president. I personally believe Clinton is extremely qualified." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Question #5: How much role should the national party, with an eye toward the efficacy of the whole organization, have in promoting its candidates of choice?" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="This is not meant to be a contentious list. I'm not sure of the answers to any of these." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I wonder out loud if we might have gone too far. I wonder if the party establishment shouldn't openly have a bigger role in promoting its candidates. I wonder if open primaries should be closed so parties can run their own nominating elections. I wonder if last minute party switching to make a primary deadline should be stopped." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="But mostly I wonder how Trump ended up at the top of one of the two \"major\" parties instead of off in a corner saying stupid stuff to an extremist crowd like Jill Stein."
      desc="(Ok that part was meant to be a little contentious. ðŸ˜¶)" >}}
