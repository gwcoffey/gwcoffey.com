I wrote this without realizing you said "youth" so I'm embarrassed to admit this was very much when I was an adult.

   {{< listapp/item title="Prerequisite: I am a giant baby. I hate scary movies. Always have. And my definition of scary is broad. I HATED the queen of hearts in the Disney Alice in Wonderland when I was little, for instance. She scared me to death and she was so so so mean."
      desc="(So were those flowers while we're on the subject. And that caterpillar. Man I hated that movie.)" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Also my parents had zero sense about movies. They took me to jaws when I was four, which scarred me permanently. And then poltergeist when I was eight which basically ruined any hope of recovery."
      desc="Or a normal life." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="So for most of my life I refused to watch scary movies." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Through high school and right into adulthood." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="But one day a few years ago I thought, you know, this is silly. I'm a big boy now. These movies are silly and fake and I have powerful rational control over my emotions." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="So one day I watched jaws. I was shocked how un-scary it was. Bleh. Stupid fake shark."
      desc="(And that scene near the end when the shark is like eating the boat and the guy gets chewed up â€” in my four-year-old recollection it was so much bigger and more violent and more disgusting than it really was. Watching it again kind of healed me of a latent vivid horrifying image.)" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I watched a few other kind of scary movies. I still don't do actual horror and have no interest..." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Anyway....now to my story." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Once when my wife and kids were away on a trip I decided to face the ultimate crapped-my-pants-as-a-kid test and watch Poltergeist." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="This movie loomed large in my psyche."
      desc="I remember my piano teacher came over for dinner when I was little and he told my parents how terrifying this movie was. I distinctly thought \"I'm NEVER going to that!\" Two days later there we were in line to see it. I hate my parents. Digression! Back to my story..." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I was maybe three quarters of the way through..." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Alone..." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="In my dark and empty house..." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="When I heard a noise. Like a crash maybe. Broken glass? Someone dropping something?" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Too close to be a neighbor." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="But nobody was home." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="And too real to be my overactive imagination." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="My lizard brain got to work and one thing lead to another and I was kind of freaked out." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="What made that noise?" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="WHO made that noise?!" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I turned on every light in the house." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I carried my giant maglight flashlight like a weapon." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I searched from room to room." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="But there was nothing." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I was so confused. The noise was absolutely real. Something had crashed, broken, shattered, somewhere." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I fully expected to find a picture that fell from the wall or a vase that somehow miraculously tipped over. Finding this would of course put my mind at ease." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="But nothing at all." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I had to watch funny clips on YouTube to get my over-active imagination under control." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Eventually I went to bed, still confused and honestly a little jittery." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="The next morning everything seemed much less scary but still..." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="WHAT WAS THE NOISE?" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Eventually I left the house and found a mess on the front porch." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="A wrought iron wall hanging that held ceramic pots of plants had somehow worked itself loose and fallen from the exterior wall, crashing the big pots on the front porch." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Huh." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Had to happen while I was watching poltergeist?" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="That seemed like the best time?" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="That moment and not any other in the ten years we've lived here?" >}}
