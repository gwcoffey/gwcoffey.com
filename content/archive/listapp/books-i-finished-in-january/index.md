   {{< listapp/item title="RESTful Java with JAX-RS 2.0 by Bull Burke"
      desc="I've been doing REST APIs in Rails for several years and I did oodles of Java web work back on the heady days of servlets and that fancy new \"struts\" but I'm new to JAX-RS so I burned through this book a couple weeks ago. Good solid book and really impressive framework."

   {{< listapp/item title="Designing Data Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann"
      desc="I'm not sure I can claim to have finished this because it is one of the O'Reilly early access books meaning the author's not done writing it yet. But I read the first seven chapters which is where it currently stops. This is a very good book that surveys the landscape and puts a lot into perspective."

   {{< listapp/item title="Programming Scala by Dean Wampler and Alex Paybe"
      desc="I only read parts of this and skimmed the rest. Not sure how interested I am but it was recommended. I'll give it a thorough read soon-ish."

   {{< listapp/item title="The complete developer documentation for Redis 3.0 and Redis Cluster"
      desc="Reading docs is always dry but I'm mildly obsessed with reading every word for any software I start using seriously so I forced my way through it. I'll probably re-read most of it in a few weeks."

   {{< listapp/item title="Evening in the Palace of Reason by James Gains"
      desc="Started this last month, will finish this week. It would break my fathers heart to hear me say this, but I find the parts about Frederick the Great way more interesting than the parts about Bach but all of it is pretty great."
