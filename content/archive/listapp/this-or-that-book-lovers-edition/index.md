   {{< listapp/item title="Physical Book or eBook?"
      desc="eBook. Unless it is not available, or the book format works better on paper. But I much prefer e." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Audio book or book in hand?"
      desc="Both. I can't pay attention to an audio book very well so all my serious reading is book-in-hand but I do listen to audio books a lot, usually things I've already read, and especially things that benefit from good readers like Shakespeare or Joyce." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Paperback or hardcover?"
      desc="Never thought much about it but I'd never pay extra just for format unless it was somehow special." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Adult or young adult?"
      desc="Adult." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Series or standalone?"
      desc="Standalone mostly but I'm not averse to series. Border Trilogy by Cormac McCarthy was my last series I think." >}}

      desc="Either. Both. Why not both?" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Starry-eyed romance or action-packed?"

   {{< listapp/item title="Curl up inside or bathe in the sun?"
      desc="Inside. I'm sun-averse." >}}
