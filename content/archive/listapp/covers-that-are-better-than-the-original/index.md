   {{< listapp/item title="Bridge Over Troubled Water / Johnny Cash"
      desc="I never liked this song until I heard Cash's version. Now it moves me deeply. http://bit.ly/1GstLQy" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Every Grain of Sand / Emmy Lou Harris"
      desc="I loved the original but Emmy's is more haunting. http://bit.ly/1GsBv54" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Can't Help Falling in Love / U2"
      desc="Sublime take on an otherwise uninteresting song. http://bit.ly/1R9TsbL" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Clay Pigeons / John Prine"
      desc="The Blaze Foley original is great. The Prine version is better. http://bit.ly/1KoTQ5j" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Knockin' on Heavens Door / Dave Grisman and Jerry Garcia"
      desc="This is probably blasphemy but I never though much of this song until I caught this Grisman/Garcia version on iTunes Radio. http://bit.ly/1GtOmnv" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="My Mexican Home / John Prine"
      desc="This is a cheat but the original studio release of this song is twangy and forgettable. A rare miss for Prine. But the reworked live version, finally released on the \"In Person & On Satge\" album is brooding, powerful, and sad and one of my favorites. http://bit.ly/1Hxb6o7" >}}
