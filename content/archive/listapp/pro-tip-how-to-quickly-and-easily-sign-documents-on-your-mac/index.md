So you're refinancing your house, filling out college paperwork, signing a lease, starting a new job...and they emailed you stuff to sign. Ugh, right? Print, sign, scan or photograph or fax. 😷 If you have a Mac, Apple has you covered. But sadly nobody seems to know it's there. THAT'S WHERE I COME IN.

   {{< listapp/item title="If you have the choice of \"Trackpad\" and \"Camera\" at the top, choose \"Camera\"."
      desc="You can sign with your laptop trackpad if you want but I think it's easier to capture a real signature with the camera instead."

   {{< listapp/item title="Hold your signature up to the camera on your computer. When the app \"registers\" it you'll see an outline representation. If it looks good click Done."
      desc="This can be a little tricky but for the most part it is like magic. Just move the paper around until the signature is fully in the frame and semi-close to the line and it should pick it up."

   {{< listapp/item title="Click the Signature icon in the markup toolbar again and choose your new signature."
      desc="When you choose the signature, a version of it will appear on the document just floating in the wrong place. (I'm artfully hiding my and my wife's signatures here but as you can see you can capture and reuse multiple.)"

   {{< listapp/item title="Bonus: Fill out the rest of the form."
      desc="The markup toolbar can do all kinds of other things including fill in blanks. Just click the \"Aa|\" icon, click on anything in the form that looks like a blank or a box, and start typing."
