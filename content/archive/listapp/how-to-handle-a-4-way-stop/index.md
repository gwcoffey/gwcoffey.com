      desc="Wait for the first to go. Then the guy who is third will go in front of the guy who is second. The guy who is second is a pansy and will proceed gingerly at this point. By the time he goes the guy who was behind the first guy will assume it must be his turn now and he will almost crash in to you and then make a rude gesture. Once you're through, pull over and write a list. You don't ever want to be fourth." >}}
