Well, @GargiBera, it just so happens I'm having tacos for lunch today! I love tacos so much and we have them a lot. Everything in this "recipe" can be adjusted/swapped/augmented in a million ways which is one of the things that makes tacos so wonderful. ðŸŒ®ðŸŒ®ðŸŒ®

   {{< listapp/item title="Corn tortillas, toasted in a dry pan to warm them up and make them a little toasty."
      desc="I prefer corn but hey I love soft tacos on four tortillas too, and I love crispy tacos too. I will say though that store-bought hard taco shells always taste stale to me so I don't buy them. And making them is a pain so we've only done it once or twice."

   {{< listapp/item title="Add some protein. I'm using leftover smoked pork here."
      desc="We usually use pollo asadoâ€”whole chickens butterflied and grilled flat on charcoalâ€”which is readily available here but maybe hard to find elsewhere. I also use rotisserie chicken which is great for tacos."

   {{< listapp/item title="Shredded green cabbage."
      desc="Cabbage holds up to heat way better than lettuce and this is more traditional. It also has a great crunch."

   {{< listapp/item title="Thinly sliced radish."
      desc="Also a very traditional topping in Mexico but not in American Mexican restaurants which is a shame."

   {{< listapp/item title="Avocado."
      desc="In Mexico they always use that \"guacamole\" that is smooth and runny. It is delicious but I don't know how to make it. I should ask some friends and report back..."

   {{< listapp/item title="(I put some pickled jalapeÃ±o on there but forgot to take a picture)."
      desc="The taco stand we frequent in Mexico has roasted whole jalapeÃ±os that are ðŸ’¯. But sliced fresh, pickled, etc. are also awesome additions." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Cebollita."
      desc="The secret weapon. Beautiful and delicious. See: https://li.st/l/4MXpxUHQevwQu4jSm64bOG"
