I got to see this movie the other day at an early screening. I honestly only went because I'm traveling alone and was bored and it was free. I watched the preview and thought "Meh, high school Juno-quirky comedy. Boring." But I'm so glad I went because it was wonderful. I'm not a film buff at all but to my amateur eye the writing was superb.

      desc="It is almost impossible to write teenagers. Probably because teenagers as a rule can't write and adults know too much. So they're always slapstick, a caricature, or insufferable. But Rachel is a kid I 100% believe exists and I love her." >}}
