   {{< listapp/item title="@ChrisK 's three guests at a literary dinner party"
      desc="Virgil, Dante, and Dan Brown because it would be interesting to watch Virgil get all embarrassed about being in Dante's Inferno and watch Dante get all embarrassed about being in Dan Brown's Inferno and watch Dan Brown get embarrassed about what an awful writer he is. And then Virgil would write an epic poem about Dan Brown and the cycle would be complete." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Chris Pratt's advice to a guy who wants to be an actor"
      desc="Advice for being an actor is this: figure out whether or not you believe in yourself, and if you don't, find a way to. Because even more than you want it, you must believe it." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="John Green on whether his stories are based on \"true\" events"
      desc="Neither novels nor their readers benefit from attempts to divine whether any facts hide inside a story. Such efforts attack the very idea that made-up stories can matter, which is sort of the foundational assumption of our species." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Ernest Hemingway on what each thing symbolizes in The Old Man and the Sea"
      desc="There isn't any symbolism. The sea is the sea. The old man is an old man. The boy is a boy and the fish is a fish. The shark are all sharks no better and no worse. All the symbolism that people say is shit. What goes beyond is what you see beyond when you know." >}}
