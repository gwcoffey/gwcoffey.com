   {{< listapp/item title="Homemade cookies. Good ones that are a bit crips on the edges with some texture and some chew. Surprise me on the type." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="There would be lots of them, enough to share with my family." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="They would be nestled in tissue paper such that once we had eaten them all and I was throwing the packaging away I would find one more hiding in three." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I would think \"oh goody\" and divide the last treat four ways so everyone could share in the surprise when they got home." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Then a bit later I would eat my quarter and save the rest for the family." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Then later I would reason that really only the kids need more cookiesâ€”Mamie and I have had plentyâ€”so I'd go ahead and eat one more quarter." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Then I'd realize they are obviously quarters so it would not take a mathematical genius to deduce that I had eaten more than my share." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="To avoid the appearance of selfishness I'd go ahead and eat the rest. Nobody needs to know. And anyway it was my package wasn't it?" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I would then feel foolishâ€”I don't even have the willpower to share a stupid cookie." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="But it was a really good cookie." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="And the package was for me." >}}
