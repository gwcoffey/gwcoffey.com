   {{< listapp/item title="Grateful Dead"
      desc="My pop went to 55 dead shows from the 70s right up to their last show at Soldier Field in the mid 90s. He would often take a week or two off with my mom and hit New York, Pittsburg, Indy, and Chicago back to back. He took us to a few shows in Indy and one in North Carolina. I watched their reunion concert with him last month and he was in tears. Beautiful moment." >}}
