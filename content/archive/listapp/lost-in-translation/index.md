   {{< listapp/item title="Audio book: \"With the aid of medicines and blood-letting, Candide's illness became serious.\""
      desc="Ha ha right? Almost Douglas Adams-esque with the little reversal in the end. (Much funnier in context of course.)" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Littell translation: \"However, what with physic and bleeding, Candide's illness became serious.\""
      desc="This one is dated so maybe it would be funny if I thought physic and bleeding sounded like medical care instead of symptoms." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Cuffe translation: \"However, by dint of many enemas and much bloodletting, Candide’s illness worsened.\""
      desc="And this one keeps the joke but it is so dry I passed right over it when I read it." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Ok @Lisa_Fav and @MaiaLS, here's the original French. Is it funny?"
      desc="\"Cependant, à force de médecines et de saignées, la maladie de Candide devint sérieuse.\"" >}}
