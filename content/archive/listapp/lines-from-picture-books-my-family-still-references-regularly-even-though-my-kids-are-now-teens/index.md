{{< listapp/list order=false reverse=false >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="\"You are not my mother. You are a snort.\""

   {{< listapp/item title="\"He will live at our house. He will grow and grow. Will our mother like this? We don't know.\""
      desc="From \"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish\". Occasionally when we talk about doing something mom or dad probably shouldn't be ok with." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="\"I did it I did it I shout to the crowd. [insert activity] by myself makes me feel so proud.\""
      desc="From a book on feelings the title of which I do not remember. Whenever anybody implies they did something on their own." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="\"Gooey goo for chewy chewing. That's what that goo-goose is doing.\""
      desc="From \"Fox in Socks\". When eating something surprisingly chewy. I'm the only one who ever says this." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="\"Both. But never mind the bread.\""
      desc="From \"Winnie the Pooh\" (I think this is the movie version. The book text was slightly different). When someone has to pick between two good things." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="\"Ohhh...Sad fish...\""
      desc="From \"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish\". Said when we see something sad. Mimicking the sweet little dramatic voice Isabel always used when she turned to that page. She actually called the book \"Sad Fish.\"" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="\"Jamma-Jamma-Jamma-Jamma-PJs!\""
      desc="From \"Pajama Time\". Said at bed time." >}}
