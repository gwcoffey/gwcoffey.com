They are lovely. They remind me of the beautiful passage from Proust when as a grown man his mother offered him tea and a Madeline cookie and he sought to understand the pleasant feeling it elicited. The whole passage is beautiful but here's the part about the recovered memories. Inspired by people inspired by @ChrisK.

   {{< listapp/item title="the shapes of things, including that of the little scallop-shell of pastry, so richly sensual under its severe, religious folds, were either obliterated or had been so long dormant as to have lost the power of expansion which would have allowed them to resume their place in my consciousness." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="And as soon as I had recognized the taste of the piece of madeleine soaked in her decoction of lime-blossom which my aunt used to give me (although I did not yet know and must long postpone the discovery of why this memory made me so happy)…" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="immediately the old grey house upon the street, where her room was, rose up like a stage set to attach itself to the little pavilion opening on to the garden which had been built out behind it for my parents (the isolated segment which until that moment had been all that I could see);" >}}
