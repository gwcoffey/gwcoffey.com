Inspired by @hels, highly opinionated. Meant to be an open list with just a couple entries but I got carried away.

{{< listapp/list order=false reverse=false >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="American Pastoral by Philip Roth"
      desc="Roth is widely regarded as one of the great modern American novelists and this book is thoroughly engrossing and highly relevant to fractured American culture." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="The Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank"
      desc="It is impossible not to love this book. Funny, moving, intimate, and breathtakingly sad. It is a must read for all modern humans and difficult to put down once you start." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury"
      desc="Short, intriguing, fast paced, and a little cranky." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Charlotte's Web by E.B. White"
      desc="The classic children's lit entry on this list and one of the most beautiful books ever written." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="The Odyssey by Homer translated by Robert Fagles"
      desc="This is a less-stuffy versified translation that makes the reading really fun. And of course this story, although it is ancient, could easily pass for a modern action film." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="All the Pretty Horses by Cormac McCarthy"
      desc="McCarthy's masterpiece Blood Meridian is the real must read but it probably doesn't meet the \"easy to get in to\" requirement. So start here instead with this beautiful story of loss, love, and the vanished American west." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Catch-22 by Joseph Keller"
      desc="I don't actually like this book much but it's an undisputed classic and an easy engaging read." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="My Antonia by Willa Cather"
      desc="This early 20th century classic novel takes as its subject lower class immigrant girls which the National Endowment for the Arts called \"a radical aesthetic move.\" It is also a touching story that's easy to enjoy." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="The Heart is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers"
      desc="This perennial entrant on \"best English language novels\" lists is staggeringly moving, beautifully written, and deeply humane. It is most remarkable to realize that McCullers was just 23 years old when it was published." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen"
      desc="Not everyone's cup of tea but worth a shot. Despite its dated subject matter it is eminently readable and very funny. And Eliza Bennet is one of the truly great female leads in literature." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut"
      desc="A short fast read that leaves you speechless. This is Vonnegut's masterpiece and a perfect example of his signature meta-fiction, dry humor, and deep humanity." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="The Feminine Mystique by Betty Friedan"
      desc="Remarkable in part because of its historical significance and in part because of its modernity. You'll be amazed how well Friedan's characterization of feminism fits current thinking sixty years later, and a little disheartened at how long we've known better." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald"
      desc="If you didn't read this in high school you must read it soon. And if you did, it's worth another read later in life. Brilliant book plain and simple." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway"
      desc="It's a Hemingway classic you can read in a day. What's not to like? And it is jam-packed with wisdom and beauty." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="True Grit by Charles Portis"
      desc="Maybe not a classic but a gem of a book, with such a distinctive and appealing voice that you can't put it down. And of course it has a place in American culture by way of John Wayne." >}}
