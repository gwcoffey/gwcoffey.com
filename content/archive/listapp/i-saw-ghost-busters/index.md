   {{< listapp/item title="Fair disclosure: I'm not really a fan of the original. I genuinely don't get why it is so popular. I was really young when I first saw it though so maybe that tainted me."
      desc="I have tried twice to re-watch it as an adult but got bored and turned it off both times. None of this is a dig at the movie itself. Lots of people I admire love this movie like a child." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Anyway my number one response to the new one is: That's it? What's all the fuss about?"
      desc="I assumed there *must* be some heavy handed \"man bashing\" in there somewhere to rile so many people up but there wasn't at all. Confused." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="It wasn't like the greatest movie I've ever seen or anything but.." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="It was very very very funny. I laughed out loud a lot. So did @mamiecoffey. And @sophster loved loved loved it." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I'm a huge Kristin Wiig fan anyway so I'll watch her in anything. She was impeccable as always." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="This Kate McKinnon person stole the show. She's ridiculously funny."
      desc="\"How about something stationary. Like a bullseye?\" \"The president is a plant!\" I'm still laughing." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="For all the crap on line about Leslie Jones being a caricature or whatever...I dunno. I thought she was hilarious and her character was multi-dimensional and integral."
      desc="She was probably the easiest to identify with, responding to the crazy stuff like a normal person." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I've always been lukewarm on Melissa McCarthy but she was great here."
      desc="I loved her in St. Vincent, but most of her movies are very much not my thing." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Chris Hemsworth should do comedy more. Way more likable as a hilarious dope than a stodgy dope." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Anyway I thought it was great. A perfect way to forget about life for a while and laugh your self silly." >}}
