   {{< listapp/item title="Press hard on the keyboard when typing"
      desc="It is life altering: you can move the text insertion point around easily and precisely without your finger getting in the way of your view." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Press hard on the edge of the screen when swiping right from the edge"
      desc="Many people know you can swipe right from the edge to go \"back\" in whatever app you're in. (Try it now! It works in The List App.) With the 6S if you press a little harder while doing this you can go back to the previous *App* instead." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Faster Apple Pay"
      desc="I use Apple Pay every place I can because it is more secure than the (grossly insecure) card swipe system. But there is a slight delay which can be difficult for socially awkward introverts like me :) My 6S reads my finger print and processes the Apple Pay transaction almost instantly." >}}
