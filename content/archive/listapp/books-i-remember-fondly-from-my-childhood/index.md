Inspired by my feed right now. I limited this to fiction but I read mostly non-fiction as a kid.

   {{< listapp/item title="The Giving Tree"
      desc="Controversial I know. First, to heck with your controversy because this was my first biggest favorite thing way before I was aware enough to discern any problematic interpretation. I loved this book more than anything in the world from before I can remember. And second, to heck with your controversy because this book is lovely." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Alexander and the No Good Terrible Horrible Very Bad Day"
      desc="Another of my early favorites." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Charlotte's Web"
      desc="My mother read it to me. My teacher read it to us. I read it myself. I read it to both my children separately. And I've read it myself in adulthood a few times. If you forced me to pick a favorite book I would refuse. But if you found a way to persuade me I'd pick this book." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="The Oz Books"
      desc="My mom read us the whole series over a couple of summers and I was mesmerized." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"
      desc="Mom read this one just to me when my brother was off reading his own books. It is such an amazing book even today." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Ramona Quimby"
      desc="Some of the first books I read and loved myself. When I read them to my kids years later I discovered they are even more beautiful than I remembered." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"
      desc="And many other Roald Dahl books. I loved the spectacular Quentin Blake illustrations as much as the stories." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"
      desc="The first very grown up book I remember reading. Can hardly remember the story but I felt very mature." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="And then I discovered Vonnegut and that's pretty much all I read until I was through high school." >}}
