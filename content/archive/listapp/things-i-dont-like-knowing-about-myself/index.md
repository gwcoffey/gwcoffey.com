   {{< listapp/item title="I treat men and women differently."
      desc="I try not to but I do. I'm more inclined to drop what I'm doing and help a woman. This is probably patronizing and certainly rooted in inaccurate culturally-ingrained assumptions about capability and capacity to deal. I'm also more likely to talk to a woman, to open up to a woman, to have a sincere conversation with a woman, and to listen to a woman. I've had way more female than male friends most of my life. Men confuse me more." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I suck at impulse control."
      desc="I love sweets. I stay up late. I get distracted. I snap at my children. I feel a little road rage." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I take the people who love me for granted."
      desc="I make a conscious effort not to but my inclination is to forget, to not make time, to not want to talk when it's expected, to not notice the little things." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I have to make up for lack of focus by working faster."
      desc="If I weren't lucky to be fast at what I do I'd be a poor employee because I lose focus and work inefficiently a lot. Especially when I have periodic interruptions." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I am uncompetitive to a fault."
      desc="I don't like to win. I feel bad when I win. I don't like to argue. I don't like to disagree. I don't like to make someone see the flaw in their thinking. I don't ask for more and I settle for less a lot. I say yes too much." >}}
