I was a lousy speller as a kid. And it spilled over to an inability to sort out strangely spelled words. This is the story of my suffering.

{{< listapp/list order=false reverse=false >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Girl"
      desc="I spelled this \"gril\" all throughout a book report I wrote in sixth grade about a book with an unnamed gril. I still believe that in a Midwestern accent this spelling more closely matches the pronunciation." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Schedule"
      desc="In 4th grade my teacher had those cartoony classroom decorations and one of them had this word. I spent all year trying to sort out what it spelled. It was a year or two later before I realized that's how you spell \"schedule\"." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Coed Naked Lacrosse"
      desc="A girl at camp had this on a T-shirt. I was pretty sure I knew vaguely what Lacrosse was, but I thought those first two words were one syllable each: code nake'd lacrosse." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Jewelry"
      desc="I remember sitting at my desk for ten minutes trying to figure out how to spell this word (Google didn't always exist, kiddos). In my defense, we Hoosiers pronounce it \"jew-luh-ree\" which is not at all how it's spelled." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="POW*MIA"
      desc="I would see these window stickers on the backs of cars and I decided it must be a summer camp of some kind: Pow-me-uh. Yeah, sounds like a summer camp." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Till"
      desc="Till is a contracted \"until\" so it obviously only has one L right? Well it turns out if you spell it that way several times in a big company wide email at work you will get teased." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Subtlety"
      desc="This word is such a spelling hot mess I just avoid ever typing it. Because those letters up there clearly spell sub-tu-letty." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Tomorrow"
      desc="When I was a kid my uncle told me, \"just remember Tom or Row!\" and for some crazy reason it worked. I've never had trouble since." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Coathanger"
      desc="In my defense, my iPhone says that isn't even a word so maybe I was actually right all those years ago when I read it as \"coath-anger\" and my dad laughed and laughed." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Condemn"
      desc="Note to 7th graders reading aloud in class: not pronounced like condom." >}}
