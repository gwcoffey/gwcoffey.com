The expression, of course, is \"money is no OBJECT\" but even that's wrong because we're not suggesting we'd pay any price for this career. We're just saying if we didn't care about making money, right? I mean I guess technically taking a huge pay cut could be considered paying a price, but that's stretching it. And anyway, \"option\" has nothing to do with it at all." >}}
