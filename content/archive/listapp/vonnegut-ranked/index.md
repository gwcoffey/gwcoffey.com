Sentimentally skewed by the order/age in which I read them. Featuring the covers I owned. Limiting myself to major works I read cover to cover here.

   {{< listapp/item
      desc="My first, around age 15. Probably higher ranking than it deserves because it blew my little teenage mind."
      image="1.jpg" >}}

   {{< listapp/item
      desc="My third, also when I was 15. Probably my actual favorite."
      image="2.jpg" >}}

   {{< listapp/item
      desc="Not until I was 17 or 18 but up-ranked by awesomeness."
      image="3.jpg" >}}

   {{< listapp/item
      desc="My fifth, when I was 16. Also blew my mind."
      image="4.jpg" >}}

   {{< listapp/item
      desc="The fourth I read, also when I was 15, maybe 16. A mixed bag but this collection has some real gems."
      image="5.jpg" >}}

   {{< listapp/item
      desc="Read when I was 17. Upranked because I saw Vonnegut speak in Indianapolis when this was published and he signed my copy."
      image="6.jpg" >}}

   {{< listapp/item
      desc="The second I read, when I was 15. I spent a lot of time thinking about this book after reading it."
      image="7.jpg" >}}

   {{< listapp/item
      desc="Read this one (an Deadeye Dick) on a long summer trip when I was 16."
      image="8.jpg" >}}

   {{< listapp/item
      desc="I did a school paper on this my sophomore year. I remember it was delightfully weird and cynical."
      image="9.jpg" >}}

   {{< listapp/item
      desc="When I was 16. I didn't love this on my first reading but I've since grown to love it more."
      image="10.jpg" >}}

   {{< listapp/item
      desc="When I was 17. One of the last for me and for some reason I've never re-read it. Probably time to. I remember loving it."
      image="11.jpg" >}}

   {{< listapp/item
      desc="I remember reading this surreptitiously in class and not wanting to stop. Don't remember much else."
      image="12.jpg" >}}

   {{< listapp/item
      desc="When I was 16 or 17. I haven't read it since. Again I probably should."
      image="13.jpg" >}}

   {{< listapp/item
      desc="When I was 18 just to round out my obsession. Also need to re-read."
      image="14.jpg" >}}

   {{< listapp/item
      desc="This wasn't published until four years after I finished high school. Not much of a novel. More the ramblings of a cranky brilliant mind too tired to pound its thoughts into something cohesive. Still essential Vonnegut."
      image="15.jpg" >}}

   {{< listapp/item
      desc="I can't find the cover I had. It was black, but not this one. Read when I was 16 and I didn't really like it much."
      image="16.jpg" >}}
