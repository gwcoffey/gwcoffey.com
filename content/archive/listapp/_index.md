[The List App][tla], later rebranded *li.st*, was a short-lived social media app from, of all people, B.J. Novak of The Office fame. A friend of mine who's way more looped in to this kind of thing than I am sent me an invitation during the pre-release beta period, when The List App was tiny and finding its footing.

The app was something like twitter for *lists of things*. There were lists, likes, re-lists, and trends. But the content of a post was always a listâ€”bulleted, numbered, reverse-numbers, but always a list of things. I think Novak envisioned things like "My favorite restaurants in LA" and "Best albums of the year" or whatever, but TLA pretty quickly turned in to a weird sometimes beautiful place where a core of likeminded and somewhat bookish people shared things that made them happy, gave encouragement, and evolved a subculture. It was fun while it lasted (and it did not last long).

When the app shut down I archived all my posts because I'm a digital hoarder. You can find them all here.
