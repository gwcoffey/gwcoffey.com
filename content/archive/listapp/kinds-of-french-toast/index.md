I'm an expert French Toast maker here to tell you what you're doing wrong. With apologies to @Lisa_Fav and @MaiaLS; I'm sure this stuff isn't really French.

      desc="The secrets to French Toast are: 1: Use good quality STALE bread. 2: Swap half the egg for just EGG YOLK. In my recipe I use one whole egg, one egg yolk, and maybe 2/3 cup of whole milk and a tablespoon of melted butter (plus a touch of salt and some nutmeg). Let bread soak for a minute or two then fry in butter until golden and cooked through. You can fake it by drying the bread in a warm oven for a while but it isn't as good. You want the bread fairly dry throughout but not hard." >}}
