   {{< listapp/item title="The drive through cashier at Hardee's in West Lafayette Indiana ca 1993"
      desc="In college my friend was driving me somewhere and decided to be a dumb teen. He went to the drive through and said, \"I'd like one french fry please.\" Without skipping a beat the cashier said \"that will be 4¢, please drive around.\" He accepted a dollar, returned 96¢ and handed my friend a small french fry bag with a single fry. To this day I am amazed by this whole experience." >}}
