   {{< listapp/item title="Once when I was 13 or 14 a bird came down our chimney." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="It was in the cold fireplace behind the closed glass doors." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="The fireplace had a gas starter. You could turn a knob and flames would light the logs." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="My father is a smart man. He finished premed in 3 years and had a long career as a very successful anesthesiologist, department chief, and hospital administrator." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="But he's not a smart man if you know what I mean." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I'll get a garbage bag and we can try to get him into it my brother said." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="No said my dad. It will just escape and poop all over the house. We need to get it to fly back up the chimney." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I'm not sure a bird can fly *up* a chimney we said." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Of course it can. It flew down, right?" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I'm not totally convinced it works that way." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Of course it does. We just need to scare it enough that it will fly away." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I tapped the glass. I rapped the glass. I banged the doors." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="The bird paced nervously." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="If we turn on the fire it will have to fly away." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="(He is not a smart man.)" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I'm not sure that will work." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Nonsense. He turned on the fire." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="The bird noticed the fire right away. The bird possessed that singular primordial certainty given to all living things that fire was a threat." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="The bird paced. It kept its distance. It began to breath more quickly." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I don't think it is going to fly out." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Nonsense." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="The bird became delirious probably from a combination of heat and terror. It became unsteady on its feet. It stumbled, jumped back up, stumbled again, and fell on its side in the fire." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Oh my god." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="My brother turned off the fire." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="The bird was charred on one side of its body but it was still breathing and trying to muster the strength to stand." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="My brother got a garbage bag. We carefully opened the doors. The bird did not flee. We picked it up with the help of the bag. It shook in our hands." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Oh god." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="We took the bird outside and laid it on the cinder block edging of an in-progress garden project in the side yard. It felt like a scene from a movie come to life. I heard myself use the phrase put it out of its misery. I was crying." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I took a heavy round log from the woodpile." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I held the log above its head. My heart pounded. I was so terrified. I think I was most afraid of the sound I was sure this would make." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Swiftly with far more determination than I felt I crushed its head completely. It became entirely still." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="It is a tender mercy of God that I heard no sound at all. No crunch. No cry. Just a thump and silence." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I didn't want to look. I turned my head, lifted the log, and returned it to the pile." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="When I turned back my brother had wrapped the bird in the bag and was carrying it away." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I yelled at my dad. He didn't say anything. My mother told me to be respectful." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I closed the fireplace doors." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="We never spoke of it again." >}}
