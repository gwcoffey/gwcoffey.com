   {{< listapp/item title="If I push back against these claims I get drowned in a torrent of half-truths, misinformation, and links to right-wing blogs with shady stories of unknown provenance." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Some of this is \"true\" in the sense that Clinton has made some very stupid mistakes (E.g. emails)." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Some of this is deeply misleading in that the facts are sad and harrowing but Clinton bears no actual guilt (E.g. Benghazi.)" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Some of this is nonsense. (E.g. Defending rapists in court.)" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="And some of it is unnuanced and hateful (E.g supporting her husband in a deeply personal and difficult situation.)" >}}

      desc="I honestly have a very hard time judging my own feelings here. I'm concerned that this too is at least 50% misogyny. I grew up in an era where Clinton was attacked constantly in the media as the butch/ugly/undignified/overbearing/etc. wife of the president and I'm afraid it poisoned the well of my own mind." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="So I'm honestly not sure how \"bad\" she is. My rational sense is that she's not particularly bad at all."
      desc="She's an opportunistic politician which I would shrug off in a man and it comes across as amplified because she's a woman and because of her history of unrelenting partisan assault." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="But maybe she's particularly dishonest." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Maybe she's particularly opportunistic." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="You don't have to dig deep, consult shady sources, lean on cultural bias, and trust dysphemistic partisan summaries of thousand page reports to spot Trump's evil." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="He is awful." >}}
