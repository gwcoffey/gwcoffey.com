   {{< listapp/item title="❌ I have a thing for leather clad ladies on motorcycles."
      desc="I mean I do, but that's not why I switched." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="❌ I appreciate the frank directness of the new CEO"
      desc="I'm from the generation that assumes their real straight talking CEO is the invention of a marketing team." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="❌ Verizon's customer support is terrible."
      desc="On the contrary, I've always found them to be polite, prompt and competent, which is everything I could possibly want from customer support." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="✅ Verizon service doesn't work reliably at my house anymore."
      desc="It has been 12 months of aggravation. I can't make phone calls reliably in my office. My LTE is slow around town. Apple, bless their hearts, gave me a new phone just in case it was my phone but alas no. After years of excellent service it just doesn't work anymore." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="✅ It is INSANELY cheaper."
      desc="I did not anticipate this but holy cow! I'm saving over $100 a month and I have five times the data cap, one extra line, data, text, and calling in Mexico included, plus no contracts. This is crazy, right?!" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Seriously guys, I came because my service was poor but I'm staying for the price. Unless it ends up being terrible. But so far everything is fine." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Also, Wi-Fi calling means I have voice service on wifi even if my cell service is poor." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I am happy with this change." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="So far." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="And no contract so if it ends up being a problem I can try someone else penalty free." >}}
