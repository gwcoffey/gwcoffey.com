Phoenix has a wonderful culture of mostly-Mexican-inspired urban murals. They are all over the city, often tucked away so you have to wander to find them. This list is long but it isn't close to comprehensive. I didn't do any South Phoenix, North Phoenix, or West Phoenix, or any of the surrounding cities. I'm sure they all have examples.
