I used to be terrible at making rice for some reason. It was always under cooked or soggy or gloppy. My friend would always tell me about water levels and finger joints and I'd be like "doesn't that depend on the size of the pot?!" Anyway, if you want *fluffy* rice with separate grains then this recipe is fool-proof and also requires no measuring.

   {{< listapp/item title="Set a timer for exactly 7 minutes."

   {{< listapp/item title="Put a little oil in the now-empty pot and put it on low heat." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Dump in the rice. Fluff it about with a fork to even it up but don't smash it down." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="If you want, add a few little slivers of butter on top." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Put a tight lid on top." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Cook on low for 40 minutes." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Fluff and serve." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="NOTE: This may produce some crispy brown bottom rice. This is generally a good thing because YUM but if you don't want that then line the pan bottom with some thinly sliced potatoes as a little barrier before you dump in the parboiled rice." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="ANOTHER NOTE: I'm experimenting with brown rice right now and I'm pretty sure this recipe would work fine for that too, but with a 15 minute parboil instead of 7 minutes. I'll update this once I'm sure." >}}
