   {{< listapp/item title="\"You see how that sauerkraut looks dry? That's because it's not wet.\"" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="\"If you don't eat meat you can use tofurkey or vegan chorizo here instead. Just kidding. Don't do that.\"" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="\"You should pick potatoes the same way you pick chefs. Short and fat, not long and thin.\"" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="\"Some extremely hot starch-on-starch action.\"" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="\"You know what they say: 'If it makes a great sandwich, it'll make a great dip.' Actually they didn't say that, I said that.\"" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="\"When in doubt, add cheese and fry it.\"" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="\"As you can see I rotated my pan here. For no apparent reason.\"" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="\"It's basically the kind of cabbage movie stars eat. Do you think George Clooney is eating regular cabbage? Heck no.\"" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="\"I prefer my ginger snaps crispy. After all, they're called 'ginger snaps', not 'ginger bend-aparts'.\"" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="\"To your guests it's going to look like you put a lot of effort into this. That's right, I said 'look like'.\"" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="\"I've actually only made this a couple of times but despite that I consider myself somewhat of an expert. Because I'm on the Internet.\"" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="\"Some people say they have trouble finding this ingredient. But they're wrong. It's easy to find. But you do have to go to the grocery so maybe that's where they went wrong.\"" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="\"I said 'confidently.' DO NOT HESITATE. A calzone can sense fear.\"" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="\"That's my take on the old calzone, which I believe in Italian means 'hot pocket'.\"" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="\"There's nothing more evil than mashed potatoes with chunks of uncooked potato in them. Yes, worse than Satan. Way worse.\"" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="\"When you take these to the table people will be thinking, 'Hmm, those mashed potatoes aren't white. They're almost butter colored. It's probably just the light. I'm sure it doesn't look that way from insane amounts of butter.' Oh but it does.\"" >}}
