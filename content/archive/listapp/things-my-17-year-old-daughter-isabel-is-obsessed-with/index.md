Well Sophie's list was popular so now I feel like a jerk for favoring my wild spunky kid over her quiet delightful sister. At the risk of sounding like one of those insufferable parents, here's what my other daughter is like. She's her sister's polar opposite, but equally awesome.

   {{< listapp/item title="Literature"
      desc="Here're a few of the books on her shelf. Although I'm an ebook reader through and through, I love that she's a paper book fetishist. Maybe the last generation."

   {{< listapp/item title="Anything vintage-y"
      desc="Here she is all dolled up for the Mad Men themed prom she attended with a friend, complete with vintage dress and crazy up do."

   {{< listapp/item title="Poetry"
      desc="Here's her entry for the school poetry contest her sophomore year. She took first place. She also took first place this year and was just designated the first annual Poet Laureate of the school for her senior year next year. She will be composing and reciting poetry for various school functions."

   {{< listapp/item title="Drawing"

   {{< listapp/item title="REM"
