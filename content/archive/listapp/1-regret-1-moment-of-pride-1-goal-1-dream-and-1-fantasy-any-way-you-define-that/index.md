      desc="I think every parent thinks this and every kid knows how much their parents screwed them up, but I tried to listen and I tried to teach, I tried to protect them, I tried to expose them, I tried to guide them and I tried to set them free. I tried to model the right things and I definitely learned every day. And I always always always loved them. I like to think I did ok."
