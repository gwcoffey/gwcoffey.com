I should say that I have zero knowledge of the story outside the six films and I hate the prequels so much I basically pretend they don't exist.

   {{< listapp/item title="...Kylo is basically trounced by an untrained Jedi in a light saber battle."

   {{< listapp/item title="...Kylo clearly has allegiance issues. Does this undermine him?" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="...On the other hand, Kylo can read minds very effectively. Palpatine could do this. Vader could but apparently only a little bit." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="...And he can hold a laser blast in mid air until he stops thinking about it."

   {{< listapp/item title="...She is definitely resourceful and strong and we see hints of force capabilities early on." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="...And she's a heck of a pilot. Perhaps the best \"using the force\" pilot we've ever seen."

   {{< listapp/item title="...And her light saber vision."
      desc="I saw the movie with my wife and two kids and we all remembered completely different things from this sequence. Is this just the first on-screen representation of what a Jedi sees, eg when Luke sees Han being tortured in the future on Bespin? Or is this something different?" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="My 2 cents on Han's inevitable death: He had to die because this is Rey and Finn's story and Han is way too big and charismatic a character to keep around. He steals the show."
      desc="Harold Bloom says this is why Mercutio had to die in Romeo and Juliet and I think it fits here too. Han steals the show every time he's on screen and this isn't his story anymore. Bye bye." >}}
