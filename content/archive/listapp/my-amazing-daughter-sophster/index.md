      desc="One time when we were at Girl Scouts when she was 9 or 10 and a bunch of older girls were there I decided to embarrass her. I grabbed her and kissed her all over the face and called her my \"baby boo boo\". She was not embarrassed. She LOVED it. She curled up in my lap and reciprocated so ridiculously that I got very embarrassed in front of all the moms. That's Sophia." >}}
