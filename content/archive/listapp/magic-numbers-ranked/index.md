This may be the dumbest nerdiest list I've ever made. It embarrasses me.

{{< listapp/list order=true reverse=false >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Fast Inverse Square Root ~ 0x5f3759df"
      desc="The most magical of all magic numbers. Google if you're curious but probably only if you're also a programmer." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Avogadro's Number ~ 6.02e23"
      desc="Just an all around fascinating number. I mean really, heavy gas, light gas, doesn't matter! It's always the same. Surprising and cool. Of course now that I think about it, the fact that it is the same is probably what makes it possible for a gas to be \"heavy\" in the first place. Idk. It's just cool." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Zero â€“ 0"
      desc="What a strange little monster. Adds nothing. Takes everything away. And makes so many things possible." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Feigenbaum Constant ~ 4.6692ish"
      desc="If God is a number he is approximately equal to 4.6692." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Tau ~ 6.28ish"
      desc="Like Pi's more refined sister, equally important, more sensible, and way less trendy." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="First Standard Deviation of the Normal Distribution ~ 68.2%"
      desc="Thanks to the central limit theorem this is one powerful little number. Thank you for making statistical analysis work." >}}
