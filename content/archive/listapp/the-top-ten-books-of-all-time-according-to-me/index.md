Inspired by @ListPrompts. I've listed a lot about books and authors so here I'm going to cast a wide net and pick some favorites across the spectrum.

{{< listapp/list order=false reverse=false >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="The Giving Tree by Shel Silverstein"
      desc="My first true love from before my clear memory begins. I still ❤️ it entirely so I don't want to hear about all your negatives interpretations 😉."
      image="1.png" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Beezus and Ramona by Beverley Cleary"
      desc="The best of a perfect series."
      image="2.png" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Charlotte's Web by E.B. White"
      desc="Perfection."
      image="3.png" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Sirens of Titan by Kurt Vonnegut"
      desc="It is hard to pick a favorite Vonnegut but this is both great and a little less popular so it seemed a good choice. And it's the purest example of the distinctive juxtaposition of cynicism + humanism in Vonnegut."
      image="4.png" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy"
      desc="This pretty much demands multiple readings and probably some background reading as well but it is a powerful good book."
      image="5.png" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="The Denial of Death by Earnest Becker"
      desc="A dated but brilliant and very eye opening survey of modern psychological thinking. Possibly this book changed my life."
      image="6.png" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Les Miserables by Victor Hugo"
      desc="Another life changer. This book reignited my love of literature after a long spell from mid-high school to early twenties of non fiction reading and not feeling smart enough to read \"real\" books. Also an absolutely beautiful book."
      image="7.png" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Antony and Cleopatra by William Shakespeare"
      desc="Again, hard to pick a favorite but this is probably it. Staggeringly beautiful, thematically powerful, utterly moving."
      image="8.png" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe by Charles Yu"
      desc="Gotta have some contemporary lit on here so this is my wildcard choice. I love everything about this funny oddball touching book."
      image="9.png" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="The Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank"
      desc="We also need a memoir/biography and this tops that list for me. So sweet, so insightful, so inspiring, and so devastatingly sad."
