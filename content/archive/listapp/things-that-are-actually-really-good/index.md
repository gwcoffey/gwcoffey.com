   {{< listapp/item title="Phineas and Ferb"
      desc="Yes it's a dumb kids cartoon but every time my daughter wrangles me into watching an episode with her I'm taken by how great it really is. Clever, funny, ðŸ’¯ music." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Mean Girls"
      desc="I know this is no surprise to you smart people but I'm an old guy with no tolerance for \"high school\" movies. Except, this movie is ðŸ’¯ and one of the funniest things I've ever seen. It is also sincerely sweet." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Harry Potter"
      desc="I adore Harold Bloom like an awesome cranky uncle but Harry Potter is great. Sure it isn't the most literary thing in the world but it has ðŸ’¯ characterization + great imagination that courses from beginning to end and it is genuinely moving." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Billy Collins"
      desc="All the smart literary people think this guy is like pop-poetry junk or something but honestly I love him. ðŸ’¯ humor + real humanity + perfect delivery." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Kraft macaroni and cheese"
      desc="I'm not a big packaged food fan, partly for health but mostly because it tastes gross. I can't think of any food I enjoy that includes neon color or a packet of powder. Except this, which tastes ðŸ’¯." >}}
