   {{< listapp/item title="50% more butter than the recipe says"
      desc="My personal recipe is a stick of butter and one and a half bags of large marshmallows. This makes them softer and richer. If that half-bag annoys you like it does me then  IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU NEED TO MAKE TWO BATCHES." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Fruit Loops"
      desc="Mostly this just makes them pretty without screwing up the texture or flavor. I do eight cups of Rice Krispies and four cups of Fruit Loops (for you non-Americans that's ... Uh ... Ask Siri). And for the love of all things holy use real fruit loops. Not those horrible all natural organic-o's they have at whole foods."
