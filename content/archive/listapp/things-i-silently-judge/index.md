   {{< listapp/item title="Over the top proposal videos"
      desc="When my wife and I entered into a verbal contract to marry it was ... more clinical. If you have an elaborate flash mob at your proposal I secretly hate you while I click Like in Facebook." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="People who are always late"

   {{< listapp/item title="Gorgeous profile pictures"
      desc="All of you are guilty of this. I too had that one picture once that made me look way better than I really look." >}}

      desc="I'm guilty of this. In a self conscious attempt to avoid feeling like I care about my profile picture I always choose one that looks stupid." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Yoga pants"

   {{< listapp/item title="BMW drivers"
      desc="I'm sure that if I actually drove a BMW I would realize it is the Ultimate Driving Machine or whatever. But as a person who walks a lot I can assure you that there is a 75% chance that BMW is going to race the light and almost kill me when I'm in the crosswalk. And a 0% chance the beater '98 Honda Accord will do the same. Consequently I quietly judge all BMW drivers to be jerks with the exception of my aunt, who is a delight." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="People who can't function in the morning without coffee"
      desc="Guys it is the coffee that makes miserable so you need the coffee. If your significant other acted that way you'd break up with them in a heartbeat. I'll run to Starbucks with you but I'm judging you all the way." >}}
