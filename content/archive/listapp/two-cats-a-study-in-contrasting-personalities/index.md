   {{< listapp/item title="This is Rosencrantz. He is five months old."
      desc="He has been running around the house like a madman since we brought him home 18 hours ago. He has jumped in my lap, over-consumed water and regurgitated it on the floor, and made a hilarious failed attempt at jumping up to the table. He occasionally overestimates the traction of the wood floor and I hear him skittling across the hall and into the wall. He checks in with me at my desk every hour or so."
