Etgar Keret is an Israeli short story writer I adore. His work is fast, moving, tight, beautiful, satirical, surreal and explosive. Here is one of his tiny stories. You should buy his book.

   {{< listapp/item title="PARALLEL UNIVERSES"
      desc="By Etgar Keret" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="There’s a theory that says there are billions of other universes, parallel to the one we live in, and that each of them is slightly different." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="There are the ones where you were never born, and the ones where you wouldn’t want to be born." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="There are some parallel universes where I’m having sex with a horse, and ones where I win the lottery." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="There are universes where I’m lying on the bedroom floor, slowly bleeding to death, and universes where I’ve been elected president, by a landslide." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="But I don’t care about any of those parallel universes now. The only ones that interest me are the ones where she isn’t happily married, with a cute little boy, the ones where she’s completely alone." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="There are plenty of universes like that, I’m sure." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I’m trying to think about them now." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Among all those universes, there are some where we’ve never met. I don’t care about those now." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Among the ones that are left, there are some where she doesn’t want me. She tells me no. In some of them, she does it gently, and in others—in a way that hurts." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I don’t care about those now, either." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="All that’s left are the ones where she tells me yes, and I choose one of them, a little like you choose a piece of fruit at the greengrocer’s. I choose the nicest one, the ripest one, the sweetest one." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="It’s a universe where the weather is perfect, never too hot or too cold, and we live there in a little cottage in the woods. She works at the city library, a forty-minute drive from our home, and I work in the education department of the regional council, in the building that faces hers." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Sometimes, from my office window, I can see her putting books back on the shelf. We always have our lunch together. And I love her and she loves me." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="And I love her and she loves me." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="And I love her and she loves me." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I’d give anything to move to that universe." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="But meanwhile, until I find the way there, all I can do is think about it. I picture myself living there, in the middle of the woods. With her, in complete happiness." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="There’s an infinite number of parallel universes in the world. In one of them, I’m having sex with a horse; in another, I win the lottery." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I don’t want to think about those now, only about that one, the one with the cottage in the woods." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="There’s a universe where I’m lying with my wrists slashed, bleeding, on the bedroom floor." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="That’s the universe I’m doomed to live in until it’s over." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I don’t want to think about it now. I just want to think about that other universe. A cottage in the woods, the sun setting, going to bed early." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="In bed, my right arm is unslashed, and dry. She’s lying on it and we’re hugging each other. She lies on it for so long that I can hardly feel it anymore. But I don’t move, I like it that way, with my arm under her warm body, and I keep liking it even when I can no longer feel my arm at all." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I can sense her breathing on my face—rhythmic, regular, unending." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="My eyes begin to shut." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Not just in that universe, in bed, in the woods, but in the other universes too, the ones that I don’t want to think about." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I enjoy knowing there’s one place, in the heart of the woods," >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="where I’m falling asleep happy." >}}
