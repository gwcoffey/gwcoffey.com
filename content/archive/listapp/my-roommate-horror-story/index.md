   {{< listapp/item title="I'm not sure it's fair to call it a horror story. At the time of course I thought lots of judgmental thoughts about my first college roommate. But looking back I think he probably struggled in ways I didn't understand." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Anyway..." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I took the lottery my freshman year and was assigned a room with, let's call him \"Tony\"." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="He was super quiet and shy to a degree I'd never seen. I'm shy but he was about eight notches more shy than me." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="He never ever looked me in the eye when we exchanged our few words." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="We lived together for four months and he probably spoke 20 words to me in that time." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="He changed clothes in the closet."
      desc="It was not a walk-in closet. He had to stoop way down to squeeze in under the shelf and rod and struggle to close the door behind him. He would then emerge in new clothes." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="He watched a lot of porn with his friend late at night on a tiny tiny television while I tried to sleep."
      desc="I know porn is all accepted and a-ok culturally right now but I think porn is gross and often problematic and it always made me sad the few times I saw it as a teenager." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Sometimes my girlfriend would come over and he would sit on his bed with his back against the wall and watch us talk and kiss."
      desc="We only did this once because it was super creepy. And also she lived far away." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I was struggling in college with my own existential crisis and began to wish for a different roommate." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="This was in 1993. It was a different time and I suppose what I'm about to say will seem hard to believe for college folks today, but it seemed sort of normal then I'm sorry to say." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="On another floor in our dorm it was discovered that two young men were gay and involved in a relationship. When this came to light, in accordance with the dark time, they both immediately dropped out of school and disappeared. ðŸ˜¢"
      desc="I sometimes think about these guys and hope that they found a more accepting place to learn and grow." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Anyway, this left an open room. So I moved in to that room with an old friend, Casey."
      desc="The room was \"tainted\" socially because it was the \"gross gay room\" so it was easy for Casey and I to get it. Nobody else wanted it." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="He and I both struggled in an existential way but we struggled together and it made a difference." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="He is such a kind man and he helped me a lot. I will always be grateful that I was able to finish that school year with Casey."
      desc="Still to this day he checks in occasionally and asks about my brother (who has had some health problems). He is one of the kindest people I ever knew." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="And as for Tony? I never spoke to him again. I sincerely hope he found someone to live with that he felt closer to." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="The next year I dropped out of school. I married my wife a few months later and never had another roommate." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Hmm. I guess the only horror story here is how two young gay men had their education aborted and their social lives upended simply by being." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Although I did not participate in any direct cruelty (and would not have â€” not my style) I'm sorry I didn't stand up for them publicly." >}}
