{{< figure src="20180308_164416.jpg" caption="I have a picture just like this of Mamie at a stone-age fort in Ireland. But this is at the “Death Oracle” of Poseidon. I’m still trying to figure out exactly what that means but it has an inner chamber with an altar that was covered in recent offerings including wine, pictures, euro coins, and Costa Rican cash. Apparently it is a local tradition to make offerings to Poseidon here to earn his favor." >}}
