{{< figure src="20180310_114152.jpg" caption="Sophie at the bottom of the citadel cistern steps. I’m honestly shocked this thing exists. A long passage through the city walls (with corbeled stone ceiling) plunges into a staircase straight into the mountain, tunneling through rock for 30 meters and terminating in a carved cistern which is in turn fed by underground clay pipes that bring water from a spring outside the citadel. This way they could have water indefinitely while under siege. I have no idea I how Bronze Age technology could make this." >}}

{{< figure src="20180310_125802.jpg" caption="I’m not sure what this means exactly but I hope it means “any time the state records you you have the right to view the recording on demand” and if so we should have that law here too. And also for private companies." >}}
{{< figure src="20180310_131821.jpg" caption="The entrance to another Tholos tomb, called the Treasury of Atreus. This thing is also amazing. That lentil stone weighs 120 tons. 3,000 years old. It resonates sound inside so effectively that we could hear the bees inside buzzing from 20 feet away." >}}
