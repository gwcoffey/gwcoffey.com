{{< figure src="20180312_172021.jpg" caption="Then back to Athens to meet up with Isabel. While we waited for her we visited the Pan-Athenaic Stadium. This stadium is a rebuilt replica of the one that stood on this location 1,800 years ago. It was the site of the first modern Olympic Games. The whole stadium is marble. Super impressive in person and a wonderful chance to see what something like this looked like in its prime." >}}
