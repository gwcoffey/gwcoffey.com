One of the stranger phone calls I've taken this week.

{{< quote >}}
[Ring ring]

Me: Hello?

Caller: May I speak with Geoffrey please?

Me: This is Geoff.

Caller: Michael asked me to tell you to be at McDowell and 33rd at 11:00. 

Me: I don't know what you're talking about.  

Caller: Is this Geoffrey?

Me: Yes. 

Caller: You spoke with Michael last week. From McDowell and 33rd? He'd like you there at 11:00.

Me: I don't know who Michael is. 

Caller: [aside] Ok, Michael, he says he doesn't know what this is about.

Michael: [aggressively] Hi, Geoffrey? Listen, we talked last week. I need you there at 11:00, understand?

Me: Michael, I have no idea who you are. 

Michael: [hangs up]

I assume this was a very unlucky wrong number but I can't shake the feeling I just forgot about something I was suppose to do. This also perfectly illustrates the plight of someone who's one phone rings for business, personal, and church with no context.
