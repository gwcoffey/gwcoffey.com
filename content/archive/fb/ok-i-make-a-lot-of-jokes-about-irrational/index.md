Ok, I make a lot of jokes about irrational reaction to Ebola but Iâ€™ll be serious for 5 seconds. If you are worried, the best thing you can do to protect America is go here and make a donation:

Of course there's no reason for Americans to be worried about their own health. But there are many reasons to help stop the current outbreak in West Africa. Every American who has contracted Ebola got it while selflessly helping incredibly sick people. Every case we will see will come from this region. And in some communities in Africa the ongoing suffering is unimaginable. You and I won't be exposed, but we can still help protect the people who might be. Including Americans if that's where you draw your lines.

Ok, back to being silly.
