When I was a kid I always thought Big Bird was a girl. And then I out grew Sesame Street. Much later, when reading Sesame Street books to my kids, I was surprised to find out she was supposed to be a boy. It still surprises me a little when I'm not thinking about Big Bird and then someone calls her "he".

Anybody else?
