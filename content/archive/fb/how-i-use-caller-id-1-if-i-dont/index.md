How I use Caller ID:

1. If I don't recognize the area code I don't answer.
2. If it is a Phoenix area code I assume it is someone who wants to talk to me, which is never fun, so I don't answer.
3. If it is a California area code I assume it is someone from work who, frankly, should be emailing me, so I don't answer.
4. If it is any other area code I'm paralyzed with indecision and end up not answering.
