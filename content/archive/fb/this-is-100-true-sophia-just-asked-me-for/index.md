This is 100% true.

Sophia just asked me for the 400th time if she can have something she knows she can't have. So I said, "Let me tell you a story.":

"There was once a farmer who had a mule to pull his cart. One day, the mule stopped abruptly to sniff some grass, and the pots fell off the cart. The farmer looked the mule in the eye and said, 'That's one.' The next day, the mule stopped abruptly to watch a squirrel and a basket fell off the cart, spilling its contents on the road. The farmer looked the mule in the eye and said, 'That's two.' The next day, the mule stopped abruptly to nibble some flowers, and the wheel fell off the cart. Then the farmer whipped the mule."

Then I looked Sophia in the eye and said, "That's one."

She giggled and said, "let me tell YOU a story!" and told me this old family-favorite joke:

"A duck went into a grocery store and said, 'Do you have any duck food?' The grocer said, 'No, this is a grocery store and we don't serve ducks. Go away.' The next day the duck came in and said, 'Do you have any duck food?' The grocer said, 'No! This is a grocery store. Now if you ask me again, I'm going to nail your feet to the floor.' The next day, the duck came in again and said, 'Do you have any nails?' Exasperated, the grocer yelled, 'No! THIS IS A GROCERY STORE.' Then the duck said, 'Do you have any duck food.'"

Then she looked ME in the eye and said, "Do you have a whip?"
