I think the most common health-care related refrain I heard from Trump supporters during the campaign was "He's not going to take away pre-existing condition protections."

Granted, I don't think Trump himself even understands the most basic fundamentals of health care, but here we are. Now the conservative talking heads are all over the media with their coordinated talking points:

- People with health problems should pay more.
- Expensive healthcare is a consequence of poor life choices.
- Hard working Americans shouldn't have to pay for people.

How quickly we've switched from "he would never" to "of course he should."
