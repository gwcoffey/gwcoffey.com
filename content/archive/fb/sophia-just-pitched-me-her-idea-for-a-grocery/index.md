Sophia just pitched me her idea for a grocery store commercial. I quote:

{{< quote >}}There would be this guy saying, 'Our fruit is so delicious blah blah blah,' and they would show another guy getting in to his car after loading in all his groceries. He says, 'Everybody ready back there?' all excited, and then it would show the back of his car and there would be one piece of fruit in each seat and each one would have a seatbelt on. Like there would be *one* orange in the seat, all buckled in safely, and then a watermelon in the next seat! It would be sooooo cute.{{< /quote >}}

I agree.
