In DOJ arguments before the court they no longer claim the travel ban addresses any imminent threat and concede that country of origin is not a good predictor of terrorism. 

Only trump himself makes these claims and only on twitter etc. when talking to his fans. Further evidence that this is racism/islamophobia and has nothing at all to do with national security. Just a way for trump to prey on ignorance to fire people up.
