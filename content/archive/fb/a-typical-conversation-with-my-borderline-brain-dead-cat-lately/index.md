A typical conversation with my borderline brain-dead cat lately:

> Cat: {feed me}
>
> Me: It isn't time to eat.
>
> Cat: {feed me}
>
> Me: Cat, it is not even close to time to feed you yet.
>
> Cat: {feed me}
>
> Me: â€¦
>
> Cat: {feed me} {feed me} {feed me}
>
> Me: [walks over to cat bowl] THERE'S ALREADY FOOD IN YOUR BOWL YOU IDIOT.
>
> Cat: {feed me?}
>
> Me: [shakes food bowl]
>
> Cat: {YAY!} [eats]
