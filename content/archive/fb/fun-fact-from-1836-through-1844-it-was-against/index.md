Fun Fact: From 1836 through 1844 it was against the rules in the House of Representatives to discuss, debate, or consider anti-slavery petitions.

This is widely considered a violation of the first amendment, specifically "the right of the peopleâ€¦to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."
