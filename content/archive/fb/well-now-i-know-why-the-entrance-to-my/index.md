Well now I know why the entrance to my neighborhood is blocked by police. Sad story.

Aside: There is a crosswalk with signal 100 feet north of here (and a block south) and yet I see people crossing mid-block all the time.

Aside 2: Can we get a signal on the crosswalk across 7th street too? That street is 10mph faster, has six lanes, has a charter school, and the crosswalk is barely marked. I'm shocked it hasn't killed someone yet.
