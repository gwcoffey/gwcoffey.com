{{< ed "This was posted the day Gene Wilder died." >}}

I think my favorite Gene Wilder thing is this letter he sent to the director of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with feedback on the costume sketches for his character. What a pro.

"I don't think of Willy as an eccentric who holds on to his 1912 Dandy's Sunday suit and wears it in 1970, but rather as just an eccentric — where there's no telling what he'll do or where he ever found his get-up — except that it strangely fits him: Part of this world, part of another. A vain man who knows colors that suit him, yet, with all the oddity, has strangely good taste. Something mysterious, yet undefined."

The whole thing is great.
