TIL that golden raisins are not just raisins made from green grapes. In fact regular raisins and golden raisins are *both* made from green grapes. But golden raisins are dried in a liquid solution that speeds the drying process. Regular raisins are air dried which takes longer and discolors them more.

Aside: They're both still disgusting.
