Proposed: The two party system is the best defense we have against someone like Trump becoming president. The open primary system undermines the role of parties in selecting and promoting strong consistent competent candidates. We may have thrown the baby out with the bath water with the McGovern-Fraser Commission. You have no constitutional right to pick candidates. Only presidents. Maybe we should roll back some of the democratic processes in the party nominating process. (I sound like Alexander Hamilton right now...)

Discuss.
