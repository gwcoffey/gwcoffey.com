I was reminded today of what may be my favorite Steve Jobs anecdote: 

{{< quote >}}A few weeks later Jobs and his family went to Hawaii for Christmas vacation. Larry Ellison was also there, as he had been the year before. "You know, Larry, I think I’ve found a way for me to get back into Apple and get control of it without you having to buy it," Jobs said as they walked along the shore. Ellison recalled, "He explained his strategy, which was getting Apple to buy NeXT, then he would go on the board and be one step away from being CEO." Ellison thought that Jobs was missing a key point. "But Steve, there’s one thing I don’t understand," he said. "If we don’t buy the company, how can we make any money?" It was a reminder of how different their desires were. Jobs put his hand on Ellison’s left shoulder, pulled him so close that their noses almost touched, and said, "Larry, this is why it’s really important that I’m your friend. You don’t need any more money."{{< /quote >}}
