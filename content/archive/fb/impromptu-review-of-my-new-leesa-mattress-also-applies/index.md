Impromptu review of my new Leesa mattress. (Also applies to my two Tuft & Needle mattresses)

{{< lines >}}
PRO: Comfortable
PRO: Easy to order
PRO: Reasonably priced

CON: Smells like a tire fire

Current status: airing out my bedroom for four days while Mamie is away in the hope that I can sleep in my own bed again eventually.
