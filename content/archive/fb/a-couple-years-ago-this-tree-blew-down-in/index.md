A couple years ago this tree blew down in the wind. All that was left was a 14 inch high trunk and a tiny branch. Before I got around to replacing it that branch had grown a ton and reoriented straight up. So I got curious and let it do it’s thing (I’m sure my neighbors loved this...)

Over the couple years the branch grew straight up. But it’s little offshoots we’re all in a plane. So the whole branch twisted to spread them out. 

Now it looks mostly normal and is taller and straighter than its sibling (planted at the same time but never broken).

If you look closely you can see the wound where the original trunk broke off, and you can just make out in the bark pattern how the whole trunk twisted. 

Pretty neat.
