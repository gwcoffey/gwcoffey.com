In Rabindranath Tagore's short story Cabuliwallah, I find this description of Sophia's fictional twin:

{{< quote cite="from Cabuliwallah by Rabindranath Tagore" >}}
My five year old daughter Mini cannot live without chattering. I really believe that in all her life she has not wasted a minute in silence. â€¦ To see Mini quiet is unnatural, and I cannot bear it long. And so my own talk with her is always lively.
{{< /quote >}}

It is such a good story too.
