Novalis' Heinrich von Ofterdingen never really comes together (which is excusable since he died before it could be finished) but holy wow is it full of beautiful passages.

{{< quote cite="from Heinrich von Ofterdingen by Novalis" >}}
The moon shone mildly over the hills, prompting strange dreams in all creatures. Itself lay like a dream of the sun, above the introverted world of visions, and restored nature, now living in its infinite phases, back to that fabulous olden time, when every bud yet slumbered by itself, lonely and unquickened, longing in vain to expand the dark fulness of its immeasurable existence.
