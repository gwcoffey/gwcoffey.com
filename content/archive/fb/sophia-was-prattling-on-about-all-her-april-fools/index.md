Sophia was prattling on about all her April Fools plans today so on the drive to school I convinced her that April Fools isn't a real thing, I've never heard of it, and it is probably something they just do at her school. I could see here whole world crumbling around her as she tried to make sense of this new reality. I don't think I would have convinced her until I called Mamie on speakerphone and explained the debate. Mamie backed me up and Sophia's mind was blown. "But but but.. Wait, wait. This is a Khalsa thing?!"

April Fools indeed.
