Me: "Why are you yelling at me?"

Sophia: [grhrhrhrhrhr]

Me: "Is it because I'm solving your problem for you before school even though you didn't tell me about it until the last minute, and I didn't give you the slightest hard time about it?"

Sophia: "NO."

Me: "Then help me understand why you're yelling."

Sophia: "BECAUSE I'M GRUMPY."

Well now, that's something I can totally understand.

Me: "Hop in the shower and try to calm down, sweetie. I love you."
