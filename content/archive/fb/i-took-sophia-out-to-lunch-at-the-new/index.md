I took Sophia out to lunch at the new pizza place across the street. The lady says "Are you here for free pizza?!" and I said "I did not know there was free pizza but I'll take it!" and then she said "you just have to like us on facebook!" and then I felt like I would look snobbish if I said "I'd rather just buy the pizza."

Thus I was socially-awkwarded into liking their page.
