I would just like to say, having now some distance from my viewing, that Luke’s engagement with the enemy is a perfect illustration of why Yoda flipping around with a tiny sword in the prequels was so stupid and wrong.

We have finally seen how a Jedi master really does things.

Understand your enemy. 

Use the force for defense, “never for attack”.

Never lose your cool.
