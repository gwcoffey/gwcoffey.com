As we fret about how we've somehow fallen from the high place in the past where the media was a standard-bearer for truth, please consider that United States Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson secretly published mostly-inaccurate hit-pieces using government secrets against his political enemies in a newspaper he funded edited by a man he paid from his State Department budget in a successful effort to undermine his own president.

The media has been used to spread half-truths and FUD since the invention of the printing press (and probably before). If you're hoping someone will fix the media you'll be let down. It is on you to verify your sources, as it always has been.
