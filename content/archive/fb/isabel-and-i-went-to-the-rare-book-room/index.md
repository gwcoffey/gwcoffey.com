Isabel and I went to the rare book room at Burton Barr branch of the Phoenix Public Library today. We got to see awesome little tiny cuneiform tablets, a Shakespeare second folio, a 16th century Eclogues of Virgil, a first edition of Twain's first widely successful work, a (rare) certified first edition of Origin of the Species, and a bunch of other cool stuff. Oddly, there were no kindles.
