The radio in my newish Honda Accord is far and away the fanciest most advanced version I've ever owned. I know it is fancy because:

1. It's interface is inscrutable. Case in point, the "main menu" has, among other things, buttons labeled "Audio", "Audio", and "Source" all three of which show the same screen. I have no idea what the difference between these is.

2. Even when you manage to find the right button you are still annoyed by the aggravatingly slow low-frame-rate linear animations. Don't worry, they're both slow and ugly so they'll annoy you no matter where you stand on this divisive issue.

3. Even turning the volume up and down somehow manages to have latency. It takes 2-3 seconds for the sound to actually get louder when you push the volume button on the steering wheel.

4. It is completely washed out and unusable when the sun comes in the windows.

I give it an A+.
