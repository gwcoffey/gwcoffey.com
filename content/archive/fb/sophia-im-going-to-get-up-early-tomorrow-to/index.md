Sophia: I’m going to get up early tomorrow to work on my film project before we go out. 

Me: Sounds good. Do you need help getting up?

Sophia: Yeah, get me up at 7:30. Actually get me up at 7. ... Well, come in and check at 7 and if I’m sound asleep get me up at 7:30. But if I’m playing on my iPad make me stop and get to work. But otherwise let me sleep til 7:30. But not if I’m faking it. Like if I was on my iPad and I put it away real quick before you come in and pretend to be asleep so I can stay in bed longer get me up. And even if not. If I’m just pretending to be more asleep than I am. ...
...
... You know what to do.
