Sophia is demonstrating the Maori "Haka" for her class today and I can't tell you how much I wish I could be there to watch.

How did this come to pass, you ask?

Sophia's friend Maia is doing her final research project on New Zealand. For their research projects they have to do a "product", which is just some kind of model, poster, experiment, or demonstration related to their topic. The teacher suggested Maia could demonstrate the Haka for the class. Maia is a tad shy and said she couldn't possibly do it

The teacher said, "You have a friend that I think would be happy to do it with you." 

Sophia was thrilled. They practiced all afternoon yesterday and it was adorable. Maia will explain and Sophia will demonstrate. Sophia has the words and movements memorized, and she does it with real gusto, as those of you who know her can probably imagine. She told me, "I'm doing the boy version, because they get to make mean faces and slap their chests. The girls just ring bells for that part."
