TIL that English “black” comes from the proto-indo-European root “bhel” with the sense of “burnt”. 

“Bhel” also has the sense of “burn” or “shine” and is the origin of Spanish “blanco” and French “blanc”. 

Which is to say, this same root gave English its “black” and Romance languages their “white”.

Apparently in the old old old days of English black may have meant “colorless” and could be light or dark.
