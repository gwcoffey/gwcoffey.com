This passage cracked me up when I read it yesterday and then cracked me up again today.

{{< quote >}}
This stereotype of Asians being tiny is a long-held misconception. For centuries, Westerners have been asking themselves why some Asians are the size they are. According to recovered Ming dynasty diaries, the first question white women asked after stepping foot in China in the 14th century was, "Oh my God, how do they eat so much rice but stay so small?"

A translator communicated the answer to them: "They’re not small. You’re actually huge." But sadly this knowledge was forgotten from the Western historical record.
