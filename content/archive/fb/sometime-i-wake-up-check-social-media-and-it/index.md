Sometime I wake up, check social media, and it is in full outrage mode over some twitter story that sounds very fishy. So I wait for the details to come out because the real story can't possibly be as bad as the vague rumors make it sound. 

And then sometimes United Airlines really does just "randomly" select a passenger, rough them up, and forcibly drag them off the plane after they've already boarded when they don't want to miss the flight they paid for to make room for some last minute United employees.

How anybody thought this was a good idea is beyond me. Amazing.
