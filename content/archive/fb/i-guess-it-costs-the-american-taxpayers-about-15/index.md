I guess it costs the American taxpayers about $1.5 billion a year to house, feed, clothe, and transport the president and his family. And apparently it costs about $65,000 over five years to resettle and establish a single refugee family. So here's an idea...just throwing this out there:

Let's accept 100,000 refugees a year and ban Trump from entering the country instead. We can spend the leftover savings on a really nice inflatable president doll. 

Budgeting 101.
