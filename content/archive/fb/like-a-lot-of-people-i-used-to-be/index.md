Then I talked to my doctor and she told me I have a serious condition. Sufferers of Water Temptation Fatigue feel thirsty every day. Sure, you can keep treating the *symptoms* by drinking water, but my doctor said it was time to fix the problem at the source — with prescription support.

Aquasis. For chronic thirst.
