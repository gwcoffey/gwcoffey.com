I'm at my mechanic's (of 15 years) for an oil change and a pipe burst this weekend so his waiting room is out of commission. Turns out he lives next door to the shop so I'm now sitting in his living room. He has car seats retrofitted as couches and chairs. There's also an art display on the wall of rectangles covered in different patterned car upholstery. 

This guy is such a car nerd and I love it.
