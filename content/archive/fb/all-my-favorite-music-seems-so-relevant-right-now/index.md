All my favorite music seems so relevant right now.

We were blessed by the minister who practiced what he preached
We were blessed by the poor man who said heaven is within reach 
We were blessed by the girl selling roses who showed us how to live 
We were blessed by the neglected child who knew how to forgive 
We were blessed by the battered woman who didn't seek revenge 
We were blessed by the warrior who didn't need to win 
We were blessed by the blind man who could see for miles and miles 
We were blessed by the fighter who didn't fight for the prize 
We were blessed by the mother who gave up the child 
We were blessed by the soldier who gave up his life 
We were blessed by the teacher who didn't have a degree 
We were blessed by the prisoner who knew how to be free 

We were blessed 
Yes, we were blessed 

We were blessed by the mystic who turned water into wine 
We were blessed by the watchmaker who gave up his time 
We were blessed by the wounded man who felt no pain 
By the wayfaring stranger who knew our names 
We were blessed by the homeless man who showed us the way home 
We were blessed by the hungry man who filled us with love 
By the little innocent baby who taught us the truth 
We were blessed by the forlorn, forsaken and abused 

We were blessed
Yes, we were blessed 
We were blessed
