An actual review on Amazon for Charlotte's Web. Presented without comment.

{{< quote >}}This book was absolutely the worst thing I ever read. My children were scared, horrified, and bored. I found the book to pontificate needlessly, to overdress otherwise humorous and warm situations with disgusting psycho-sexual overtones, and to instill, in myself (at least for a day) and my children (forever?), a feeling of hollow sadness and bitterness at this calous author.{{< /quote >}}
