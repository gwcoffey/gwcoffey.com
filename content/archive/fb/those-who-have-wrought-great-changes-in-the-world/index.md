{{< quote cite="Martin Van Buren (who, incidentally, never really managed to excite any multitudesâ€¦)" >}}
Those who have wrought great changes in the world never succeeded by gaining over chiefs; but always by exciting the multitude. The first is the resource of intrigue and produces only secondary results, the second is the resort of genius and transforms the universe.
