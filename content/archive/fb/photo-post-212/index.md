Also, I'm not a comic book person at all (never read one) and don't really like comic book movies much, but this actual shot from the latest Avengers preview is so Joss Whedon it makes me smile. The man knows what he loves and knows how to pay his respects. I wonder how much effort they put into composing this sequence to end up with a shot like this? It makes me wish I was a comic book geek so I could be thrilled by it.
