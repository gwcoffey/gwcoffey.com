My first and last comment on Trump and the far-right xenophobic freakout, which has saddened me more than anything I've seen so far in our temporarily divided country:

To my Muslim friends, neighbors, countrymen, and visitors, I love you as my brothers and sisters, as I love christians, jews, sikhs, atheists, agnostics, pastafarians, and everything else. Trump does not represent me, a VAST majority of the people I know, or my country. Those of you who are here, we are richer for it. Those who are coming, I welcome you into our lives with open arms. I know many of you have been persecuted by my fellow citizens because of your name, your skin, your dress, or your faith. I have seen this with my own eyes and it breaks my heart. I am sorry. I believe firmly that we will remember our decency in the end. In the meantime, stay strong, stay hopeful, and remember the millions here who try to harbor only love. Salaam.

To Donald Trump: Should it come to this you will receive our clear message in November. Until then, good day.
