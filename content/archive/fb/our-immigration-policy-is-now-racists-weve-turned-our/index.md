Our immigration policy is now racists, we've turned our backs on refugees entirely, our president sets the standard for meanness, the KKK is dancing with joy, ISIS is running ads reminding potential radicals that the USA is actively at war with Islam itself (and they're not wrong...), the national security council is now politicized and crippled, the state department is in shambles, the park service is in open rebellion, and the Queen of England is probably planning to feign a cold to avoid having to shake our president's tiny little hand...

But at least we'll have a supreme court justice that recognizes my employer's right to make medical decisions for me.
