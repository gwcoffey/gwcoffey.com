I have some exciting news to share. Effective January 31st I am exiting Six Fried Rice and starting a position as a software engineer at Apple, Inc. I believe this opportunity will challenge me in all the right ways. It does mean, however, that I must say goodbye to Six Fried Rice.

I want to give my sincerest thanks to Jesse Antunes, who has been the most ideal business partner imaginable. His strengths have augmented my weaknesses perfectly. He has been honest, dedicated, supportive, patient — I don’t think we’ve ever had a serious disagreement in eight years running a business together. And most importantly he is a good man, full of care for the people he loves. It has made a difference. Thank you.

I also want to thank all my customers for trusting us with your important work, and giving us the opportunity to do fun things and get paid for it. We have been blessed with exceptional, challenging, reliable clients and I consider many of you to be friends. Of all we’ve done in the last eight years, the thing I’m most proud of is the longevity of our client relationships. We’ve been working with a few of you since the very beginning, and many of you for more than five years. Thank you.

And finally to all of you in the FileMaker community who supported us in the early days and have continued to do so: Thank you. It was a good run and Jesse and I both felt so much support from our FileMaker friends right out of the gate.

Jesse will continue to operate Six Fried Rice and our staff will remain intact. I will simply bow out, a little sad, but mostly excited.
