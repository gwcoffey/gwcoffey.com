I don't know who Lisa Borowsky is or what she stands for, but I'm voting for her because she's blonde.

{{< ed "To be clear, this was in response to campaign posters plastered all over the city that just said \"Lisa Borowsky\" over a photo of a pretty woman with blonde hair. No mention of the position she was running for, any party affiliation, etcâ€¦ Just a pretty face and a name." >}}
