I wish CNN would run a front page story *every* time an American teen is killed with a gun, not just when the victim is pretty, white, middle class, and a few of her friend go down with her. Not because I fault them for running the stories that get page views. But because I think it would properly illustrate the real breadth of the problem.

Hint: Thereâ€™d be 6-10 front page stories every day, 7 days a week.
