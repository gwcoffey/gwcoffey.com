I recently read "The Feminine Mystique" by Betty Friedan and in it she talked about "a moment of democratic truth." I thought that was a perfect description of the same sex marriage debate. Right now we decide if we are the America we are all rightfully proud ofâ€”an America built on the paradoxically self-evident and idealistic truth that all men are created equal. Or if we are a superstitious America. One that fears what it does not understand and cannot control. One that would punish the few to protect the vain imaginations of the many. If we as a people have anything to fear at all in this, it is the corruption of our character as we continue to turn our backs on equality. There really is no rational argument, no debate, no room for considered disagreement. There is, in this question, only right and wrong. And it is time that we choose the right.
