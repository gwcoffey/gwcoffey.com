Sophia's in breakfast heaven this week. In honor of her new braces (and in deference to her sore teeth) we're having a different hot grain cereal each day. Cream of Wheat yesterday. "Special" Oatmeal today. Corn meal mush tomorrow.

These are a few of her favorite things. Any suggestions for Friday?
