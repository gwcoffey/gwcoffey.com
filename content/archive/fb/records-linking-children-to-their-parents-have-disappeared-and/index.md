"Records linking children to their parents have disappeared, and in some cases have been destroyed â€¦ leaving the authorities struggling to identify connections between family members."

Note to federal workers: When you boss tells you to take children from their parents without cause, and there is no system in place to track them so they can be re-unified in the future, you have exactly one choice: Refuse and quit your job.

The CBP workers who did this, from top to bottom, should be charged with crimes and jailed.
