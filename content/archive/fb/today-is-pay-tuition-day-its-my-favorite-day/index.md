Today is "pay tuition day". It's my favorite day because I get to solve the mystery of how much I actually owe. You might think from this picture that the answer is $172.33 but you would be wrong. On the bright side, I know how to get the right answer using a spreadsheet, a lot of copy/pasting, and cross checking numbers on a couple different pages. Give me like 30 minutes and I'll figure out how much to write the check for. Exciting!

Aside: This "afford.com" college payment system is a little poorly designed.
