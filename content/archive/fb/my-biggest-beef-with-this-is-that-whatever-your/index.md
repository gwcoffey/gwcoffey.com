My biggest beef with this is that, whatever your position on the Russia investigations, Flynn is *not* a good guy.

He is an islamophobe, which is just like an antisemite, an overt racist, a white supremacist, or a flagrant misogynist: A bad guy. I'm not suggesting his parents should disinvite him from thanksgiving dinner, but he didn't belong in a position of authority once he showed his true colors. I wish people would stop equivocating on this.
