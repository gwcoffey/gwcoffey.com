4 or 5 years ago Sophia proudly announced that she was "made" on April 8th. This she determined because she was told the average gestation period for a human, and did some calendar work to figure it out. Ever since then she has been quite proud of her "conception date" (hence the cake she made today). This is terribly embarrassing when she brings it up in polite company but I don't have the heart to tell her to stop. So, happy conception day, Sophia!
