I just ate massive quantities of homemade potato dosa plus several other things I cannot name at the home of the family of the little girl Isabel tutors, and now I am in the pleasant conflicted place where the pleasure of good food competes with the why-did-I-eat-so-much. I kind of love that place, truth be told.
