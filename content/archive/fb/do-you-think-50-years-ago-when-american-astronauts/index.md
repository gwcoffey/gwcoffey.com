Do you think 50 years ago when American astronauts were circling the dark side of the moon, and in the silence and isolation, they got to philosophizing together about what the world would be like in 50 years, any of them suggested maybe, 50 years laterâ€¦

America wouldn't even have the technology to put a person in space at all anymore?

It must be strange to have had a front seat to that comedown.
