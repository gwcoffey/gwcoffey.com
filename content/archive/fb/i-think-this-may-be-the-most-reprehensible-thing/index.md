I think this may be the most reprehensible thing trump has said so far. 

Translation: "Instead of working to address issues with our healthcare system I will work to destroy it, killing people in the process, to try to score political points."

This is indefensible. I realize this goes without saying but this man is not a president. He's a monster. 

We desperately need to get back to working together to solve real problems.
