@gwcoffey here. Love and peace to you all.

This passage is on my mind tonight. 

{{< quote cite="from Gitanjali by Rabindranath Tagore">}}
"Prisoner, tell me, who was it that wrought this unbreakable chain?"

“It was I,” said the prisoner, “who forged this chain very carefully. I thought my invincible power would hold the world captive leaving me in a freedom undisturbed. Thus night and day I worked at the chain with huge fires and cruel hard strokes. When at last the work was done and the links  were complete and unbreakable, I found that it held me in its grip.”
