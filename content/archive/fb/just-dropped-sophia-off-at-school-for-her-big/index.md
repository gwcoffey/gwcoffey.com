Just dropped Sophia off at school for her big Sixth Year Presentation on the Galilean Moons of Jupiter. She's been working on this all year and is super excited. In fact this conversation happened while she was getting ready:

Sophia: I'm so excited!
Me: Can you hide it?
Sophia: No.
Me: Are you about to lose control?
Sophia: Yes.
Me: Do you like it?
Sophia: I think.

You may be wondering why she's wearing a men's suit. Well, it's because THAT'S THE WAY SHE ROLLS.
