I just called in response to a "suspicious activity" email from Bank of America. The guy that answered was laughing and talking to someone else, then cleared his throat and said, "uh, this is, uh, Bank of America [laughter], uh, can I get your credit card number please?" 

So I hung up assuming it was some scammer, called the main number, got routed to the fraud department, and it turns out that really was the Bank of America fraud security department, and I really did have suspicious activity.

Keepin' it classy, bofa.
