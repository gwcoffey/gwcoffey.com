Took this big hearted dreamer to La La Land and she's still processing.

{{< quote >}}{{< lines >}}
A bit of madness is key
To give us new colors to see
Who knows where it will lead us?
And that's why they need us

So bring on the rebels
The ripples from pebbles
The painters, and poets, and plays

Here's to the fools who dream
Crazy as they may seem
Here's to the hearts that break
Here's to the mess we make
