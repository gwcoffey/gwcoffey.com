Sometimes I go to the movies and order a medium popcorn. The cashier always says, "Do you want to upgrade to a large for 50Â¢ more? You get a free refill."

I always do, which makes no rational sense because what that question really means is, "Do you want to buy more popcorn than you want? If you do you can get even more."
