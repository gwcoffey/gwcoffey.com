Isabel took their babysitting charges to the Science Center on the Light Rail today, and now they're taking them home, then riding the train back to our house. Such a metropolitan young person.

Also, they got their driver license today. Alas, in Arizona they can't take passengers (with a few exceptions) for six months.

Anyway, a fun transportation day all around.
