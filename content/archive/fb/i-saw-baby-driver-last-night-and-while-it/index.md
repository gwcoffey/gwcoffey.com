I saw Baby Driver last night and, while it maybe got a little lost in the last third, overall it was crazy good. I haven't had this much fun at the movies since Run Lola Run. I'm not a movie buff but to me it was just completely original, crystal clear in its vision and wildly precise in the execution of that vision. Like nothing I've ever seen before. A+
