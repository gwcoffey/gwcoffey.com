On Friday afternoon Sophia asked me “What does the 4th dimension mean?” By late Friday night we were still talking about it. We covered a little bit of relativity and a whole lot about spatial dimensions, projections, extrusion, tesseracts, plus some reading from Flatland and a youtube video based on Flatland. She was totally fascinated, and a little infuriated that she couldn't visualize a tesseract.

There's nothing more fun than childhood curiosity.
