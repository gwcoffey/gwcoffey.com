I’ve become hopelessly addicted to those “Mail you meal ingredients and a recipe” services except that it’s too hot in phoenix in the summer and their boxes can’t stay cold. So I have to turn them off until September or October.

And now I have no idea what to make for dinner. How did this used to work? Do you find a recipe first and then find ingredients? Or do you do it the other way? I can’t remember.
