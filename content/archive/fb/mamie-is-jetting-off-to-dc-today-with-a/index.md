Mamie is jetting off to DC today with a cadre of law enforcement personnel and judicial folks her employer sponsored for training on proper response to human trafficking. She's been planning, phone-calling, paperwork-printing, and so much more for days to get everything coordinated and everyone there (including a handful of folks who need to get through airport security with their weapons). I couldn't be more proud of her. I only hope she finds a little time to enjoy DC while she's there.

Say "hi" to the Obamas for me, darlin'!
