Credit where credit is due. It's a small thing but the first thing I've seen where Trump has made the right and humane decision. And considering the reports of and draft language from a possible reversal order, and Pence's widely recognized abhorrent positions on LGBT issues, it seems likely it was Trump himself that pushed this outcome.

I also think there's a reasonable chance the clear voice of the American people protesting over the last two weeks helped ensure this decision.

Now, onward and upward...
