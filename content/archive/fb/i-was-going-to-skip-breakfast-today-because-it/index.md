I was going to skip breakfast today because it is pulled pork lunch day at my work cafeteria, which must be respected. But then two coworkers walked up with big plates of "duck hash" with a fried egg on top. You can't really rationally skip a breakfast like that either...

Long story short: I ate too much.
