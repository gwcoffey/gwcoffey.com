Today Sophia asked me why a painted typographic business sign she saw looked so "wrong". I explained the concept of kerning and the paradoxical phenomenon that what is mathematically precise doesn't always "look right". This, I said, is one thing that separates good typography from bad.

We had a lovely discussion and then she said, "Adrian Monk would be a TERRIBLE typographer."

She can work Monk into any conversation.
