Sophia had to write an essay for school on her talents and how they will help her in life. Among other things:

"I am pretty good at making pies with pastry crusts. This will help me if I am ever pieless and want a pie."

And:

"I am also good at gardening. If I ever want fresh food it will be good to have a garden that is not dead."
