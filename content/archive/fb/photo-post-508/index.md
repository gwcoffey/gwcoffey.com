True story. Sophia decided to dress like a cowgirl today. If you know her well you know she just does this sort of thing sometimes. No occasion necessary. A few hours later I decided to take her and a friend to the trampoline park. And then this happened:

ME: You should put some more comfy clothes on so you can jump and play. 

SOPHIA: Dad! I'm a cowgirl. 

ME: You can do what you want but I think you'll be more comfortable in some stretchy pants instead of blue jeans. 

SOPHIA: (excited) Oh! I have jeggings! I can be a comfy cowgirl!

(Runs off to change)

Moral: Sophia owns jeggings.
