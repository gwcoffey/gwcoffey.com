{{< quote cite="Supreme Court Justice David Davis, 1866" >}}
The nationâ€¦has no right to expect that it will always have wise and humane rulers, sincerely attached to the principles of the Constitution. Wicked men, ambitious of power, with hatred of liberty and contempt of law, may fill the place once occupied by Washington and Lincoln.
