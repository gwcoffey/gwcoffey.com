A snippet I've saved and re-read a thousand times seems pertinent today.

"Go through the world with open eyes, and listen not only to your own pains and interests, but also to the pains, interests and longings of others.  Don't ever think of anything as none of your business. No, everything must interest you, and you should reflect about everything, compare, compose individual phenomena. Man doesn't live in the world alone; in that there is great happiness, but also a tremendous responsibility. That obligation is first of all in not being and not acting exclusive, but rather merging with the needs and the goals of others. This does not mean to be lost in the multitude, but it is to know that I am part of all, and to bring one's best into that community."
