I just found out Kelly Anne Conway has children.

"Mom, did you eat my Halloween candy?"

"You want to talk about Halloween? What about all these teenagers who hardly even dress up and they expect candy with no effort? What about that, Tommy? Where's the outrage about that?"

"Ok. ... But like did you eat my candy?"

"Look, the candy was eaten, that was already made clear. I'm not sure what you're getting at."

"I can't believe you won't admit it."

"I am presenting alternate facts."

[Aside] "ðŸ™„ She does this all the time."
