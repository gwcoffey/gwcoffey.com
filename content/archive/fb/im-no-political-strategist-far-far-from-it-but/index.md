I'm no political strategist (far far from it) but honestly I'd like the dems to just vote on Gorsuch's record and qualifications and not play games. Demonstrate how grownups behave. Yes, the Republicans blocked and blocked and even threatened to block Hillary's nominations for four years. And yes McConnell has zero credibility. But:

1. I'm not sure it does the nation any good to use the worst behavior of the Republicans over the last 8 years as a template moving forward.

2. The failure to turn the Garland blockade around was a political failing by the Dems. As they say in business, never throw good money after bad.

3. The real legitimate serious concerns we have with Trump's presidency and Ryan's policy positions are only weakened when we are willing to spend just as much capital on bad causes.

Because the thing is, Gorsuch is perfectly qualified. The only reason to oppose is spite, which is a lousy reason to do *anything*, especially govern.
