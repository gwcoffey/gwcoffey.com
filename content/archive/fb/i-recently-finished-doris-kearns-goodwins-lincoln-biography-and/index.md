I recently finished Doris Kearns Goodwin's Lincoln biography and am currently reading Ronald White's biography of Grant. I've also been watching Ken Burns' Civil War documentary in the evenings. It is pretty surreal to have had my head steeped in this stuff for the last few weeks and then pull up the news. 

I have no point. Just felt like sharing.
