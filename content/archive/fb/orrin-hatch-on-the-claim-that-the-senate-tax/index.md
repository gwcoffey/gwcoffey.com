Orrin Hatch on the claim that the Senate tax bill primarily helps the wealthy:

“I come from poor people and I’ve been here working my whole stinkin’ career for people who don’t have a chance. And I really resent anybody saying that I’m just doing this for the rich… We didn’t have anything. So don’t spew that stuff on me — I get a little tired of that crap!”

Orrin Hatch on why they haven’t reauthorized the Children’s Health Insurance Program (which he himself sponsored back before the Republican Party went off the cliff) and protected other social welfare programs:

“I have a rough time wanting to spend billions and billions and trillions of dollars to help people who won’t help themselves – won’t lift a finger – and expect the federal government to do everything.”

Sigh.
