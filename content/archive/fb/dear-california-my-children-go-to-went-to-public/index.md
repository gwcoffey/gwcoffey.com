Dear California:

My children go to (/went to) public schools in Arizona. My family lives in Arizona. I use Arizona roads. On the rare occasions when I need emergency services, I need them in Arizona.

When I'm working in California I stay in California hotels, eat in California restaurants, and pay California sales and hospitality taxes. Meanwhile, my entire family, which I support financially, is still living in Arizona.

I work 5 days a week, and 2 days a week + holidays and other time off is all spent in Arizona. During those non-work days I'm not technically earning money but am technically consuming state resources.

All this to say that your claim that I owe you income tax that would normally go to my own home state, calculated as a percentage of work days spent in California, is bogus.

Sincerely,

An Arizonan
