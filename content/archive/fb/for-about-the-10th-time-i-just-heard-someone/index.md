For about the 10th time I just heard someone say he's a man, but Obamacare forces him to pay for prenatal care. Ok people, listen closely. I positively guarantee you if your doctor bills Blue Cross for a prenatal visit, and you're a man, they will deny the charge. You can count on this. So by any practical measure, you do not have coverage for prenatal care. This whole line of thinking is bordering on silly.

Does the group policy you're a part of cover prenatal? Yes. Do men on that policy get actual payments for prenatal? Of course not. Is the insurance company smart enough to figure out that they'll never pay for prenatal for men? Of course. Do their actuarial calculations take this into account? Obviously. So are you paying for services you don't need? No. Do we all bear the cost of important health care for everyone in our group? Yes. That's the whole point.

End of rant.
