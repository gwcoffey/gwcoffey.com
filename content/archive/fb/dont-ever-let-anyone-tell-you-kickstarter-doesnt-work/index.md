Don't ever let anyone tell you kickstarter doesn't work. I backed the Vonnegut documentary 20 months ago and the thank you gift that was promised for fall 2015 came today. Still no documentary but, like, this is a start...?

(To be fair they were communicative about the delay and had a good reason. I'm just happy I have my book. Can't wait for the movie.)
