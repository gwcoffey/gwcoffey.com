Sophia's application for a new school for 7th grade asked her "What are your plans for college?" Strange, I know. I think it is because they use the same application for all grades through high school. Anyway, this was her answer, which I let her keep because, hey, they ought to know what they're getting in to:

"I don't know. I'm in 6th grade. What are your plans for your funeral?"
