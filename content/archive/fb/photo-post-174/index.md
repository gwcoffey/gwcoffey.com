And this is a great time to remind you all that Pluto was discovered by astronomer Clyde Tombaugh right here in Arizona at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff on February 18, 1930. ❤️

You can see the telescope he used on display in the original observatory. And do a million other cool things. It's a great family outing. http://lowell.edu
