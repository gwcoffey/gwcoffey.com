Questions Sophia has asked me in the last thirty minutes:

1. does a dead body count as a person for the carpool lane?
2. does a brain dead person who is technically still alive count?
3. does a body part count?
4. brain in a jar?
5. what if your passenger dies while you're driving in the lane?
6. if dead people counted would ashes of a person count?
7. would a shrunken head count?
8. would it count if it could talk?

[this went on for 15 minutes then thankfully she got off the irreverent carpool loophole thread]

9. if someone had laser eyes, would the lasers shoot at what they were looking at or could they be aimed?
