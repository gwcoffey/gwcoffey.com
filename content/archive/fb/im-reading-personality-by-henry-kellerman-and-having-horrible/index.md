I'm reading "Personality" by Henry Kellerman and having horrible flashbacks to my MBA days where we were subjected to textbooks full of great content couched in horrible writing.

The passive voice is extensively used (along with) odd parentheticals. And: So! Many! Exclamation points! 

My favorite sentence so far:

{{< quote cite="Personality by Henry Kellerman, pub. 2012" >}}
Then, in part 2, I present these basic personality types and styles along with actual clinical examples of each (and as mentioned above) also with reference to how each actual type may appear when expressing a more normally inclined personality style of that type.
{{< /quote >}}

o_O.
