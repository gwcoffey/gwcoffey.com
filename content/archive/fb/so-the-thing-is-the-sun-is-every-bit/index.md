So the thing is, the sun is every bit as dangerous when *not* eclipsed as when it is eclipsed. Its just that people aren't in the habit of staring at the sun so it isn't a big deal. If you don't put sunglasses on your dog when he's out for a walk then you probably don't need to worry about the eclipse either. Dogs are smart enough to not stare at the sun, and they have no interest in eclipses.
