"When you guys put somebody in the car and you’re protecting their head, you know, the way you put their hand over," he mimicked an officer putting a handcuffed person in the back of a squad car, the officer’s hand over the suspect’s head. "Like, don’t hit their head and they’ve just killed somebody? Don’t hit their head?"
