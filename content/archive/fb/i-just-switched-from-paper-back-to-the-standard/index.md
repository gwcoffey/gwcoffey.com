I just switched from Paper back to the standard Facebook app last week because it was pretty clear it wasn't being updated with new feature like reactions and nested comment replies. The funny thing is I never even used its news reading feature. I just used it to do normal Facebook stuff.

It's a darn shame because I liked Paper 10,000 times more than the normal app. Paper was like Facebook focused only on the stuff you care about, with a smooth, clever, pleasant interface. Photos were bigger. Navigation was more clear. Videos worked better. Panoramas were handled nicely. And the overall layout was just more intuitive. The real app is, alas, an everything-and-the-kitchen-sink kind of thing. I'm slowly getting re-acquainted with it though. Oh well. Et in Arcadia ego.
