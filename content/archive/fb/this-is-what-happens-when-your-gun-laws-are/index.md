This is what happens when your gun laws are reactionary and poorly thought through. Real, credible threats of violence, and the university believes that by law they can't stop people from bringing guns to an event.

1. Utah, get your crap together.
2. Utah State University, don't be such legal weenies. Post a sign and don't let guns in. Let the state sue you if they want. It is obviously the right thing to do.
