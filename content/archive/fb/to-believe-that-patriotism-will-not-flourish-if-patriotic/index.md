{{< quote cite="Justice Robert H. Jackson, West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, 1943" >}}
To believe that patriotism will not flourish if patriotic ceremonies are voluntary and spontaneous instead of a compulsory routine is to make an unflattering estimate of the appeal of our institutions to free minds.
