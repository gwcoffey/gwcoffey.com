While I was at the DMV with Isabel to get her permit, I decided to go ahead and get a new license. It was probably time for an update. (Ok, truthfully the DMV person got a little mad at me for my ridiculously old license and told me I have to replace it every 6 years. See you in another 20 years, suckers.)
