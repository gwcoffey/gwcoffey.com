1. Monkey takes selfie.
2. Guy who owns camera includes monkey selfie in book of photos.
3. PETA sues photographer on behalf of monkey for violating monkey's copyright. 
4. PETA settles out of court and drops suit. [conjecture: because PETA knows they will lose and they don't want the precedent established]

5. 9th Circuit Court says they will issue a ruling anyway (which remember, PETA doesn't want). The reason?

And: scene.
