You know how sometimes something happens like a woman whose ancestry includes people from India wins Miss America and a handful of uber-dummies on Twitter get up in arms because Miss America is "supposed to be an American"? They seem wholly unaware of the fact that she is indeed an american because, of course, they conflate "american" with "white" which is obviously racist. And you think, well, it is a shame that people like that have a platform to spout their ignorance to a wide audience, but ultimately they're just confused, powerless people pushing back against the wrong enemy. You might even think the fact that their words are newsworthy is an indicator of how outside the mainstream they are, which is, in a roundabout way, maybe even a little promising. You think, "Sigh, I guess they're out there somewhere, but they're the fringe and I wish we'd stop giving them so much voice."

Well, one of those people is the presumptive republican nominee for president. 

"If you are saying: He can't do his job because of his race, is that not the definition of racism?"

"No, I don't think so at all."

I don't know what to think anymore.
