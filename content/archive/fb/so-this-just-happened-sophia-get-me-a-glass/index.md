So this just happened:

Sophia: "Get me a glass of water."

Me: "Get it yourself. I'm not your servant."

Sophia: "Ehâ€¦I'm not that thirsty."

[5 minutes later, I get myself a glass of water, drink half of it, and then because I'm a softy I take the rest to her.]

Me: Wait, you have a glass of water already. 

Sophia: Oh yeah. I forgot about that.
