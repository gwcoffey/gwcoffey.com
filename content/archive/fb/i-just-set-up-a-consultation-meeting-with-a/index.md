I just set up a consultation meeting with a new client. And then after I hung up I looked him up and he is actually with a company that is one of the worst dead-beat clients we've ever had. He must be new. Now I get to decide how professional I should be. I can:

A: Cancel the meeting and explain that we refuse to do business with them.

B: Skip the meeting and laugh at him when he calls wondering where I am.

Or, my personal favorite:

C: Show up at the meeting, watch his boss squirm when he sees me, then hand him a bill for the consultation.

Decisions decisions.
