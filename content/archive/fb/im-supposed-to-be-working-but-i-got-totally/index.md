I'm supposed to be working but I got totally taken in by this article by Michael Chabon about taking his fashion-obsessed son to Paris Fashion Week. I don't know diddly about fashion and anybody who's ever seen me dressed knows I definitely don't care either. But the conclusion here is universal and perfect. I dedicate this reading to my kids.
