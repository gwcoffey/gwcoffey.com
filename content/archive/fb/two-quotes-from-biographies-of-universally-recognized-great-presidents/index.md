Two quotes from biographies of universally recognized great presidents are mashing up in my head vis a vis the trump administration. 

From Doris Kearns Goodwin on Lincoln: "That Lincoln, after winning the presidency, made the unprecedented decision to incorporate his eminent rivals into his political family, the cabinet, was evidence of a *profound self-confidence*â€¦"

And from Jon Beacham on Jefferson, who notoriously traveled without servants, wore frumpy clothes and dingy slippers, and had a "primeval simplicity of manners": "Jefferson knew who he was, and he knew his place in the world, so *he had nothing to prove* by constantly appearing perfectly turned out."

Compare to trump, who surrounds himself with sycophants and solid gold toilets.
