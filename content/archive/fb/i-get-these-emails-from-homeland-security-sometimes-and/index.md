I get these emails from Homeland Security sometimes and at first I always think they're from Khalsa Montessori School. Then I wonder why Lindsay and Karen are yelling at me. Then I wonder why they're calling me a "Stakeholder." Then I remember my kids don't go there anymore. Then I feel a little sad. Then I click Delete.
