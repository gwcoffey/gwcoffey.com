1. Trump starts the "Trump Foundation" to which he contributes no money of his own, but which receives private donations.

2. Eric Trump runs a golf tournament fundraiser. 

3. Eric promotes that because all facilities are donated, almost all financial donations go directly to St. Jude's.

4. But the Trump organization bills Eric Trump's foundation for use of those "donated" services.

5. And offsets the cost with a donation from the Trump foundation.

Et voila! Private donations to Trump Foundation end up in Trump's pocket as revenue.

Add a little extra spice (suspicious personal purchases by the Eric Trump foundation, and unaccounted for costs) and you have just another day in Trump land.
