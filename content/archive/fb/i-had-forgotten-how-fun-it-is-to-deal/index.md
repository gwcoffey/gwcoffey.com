I had forgotten how fun it is to deal with incompetent university bureaucracy. This was the actual conversation when I paid the first payment on Friday:

Me: I need to make the first tuition payment. It is due today. But on your web site when I try to make a payment it says the amount due is $0 and it won't let me continue.

Them: Hmm. It looks like you haven't been billed yet.

Me: Ok, but the payment is due today?

Them: Yes.

Me: ...

Them: Sometimes the bills don't go out right away.

Me: So do I need to make a payment?

Them: Yes.

Me: Uh, how much am I supposed to pay.

Them: Just estimate it and type whatever amount in.

Me: So how much should I estimate?

Them: Whatever you think the bill will be.

Me: ... But ... you are the one ... I mean you ... well ... you know what, never mind.

And then I just paid a semi-random amount. Which still hasn't actually been deducted from my account. And I still haven't been billed. So who knows. Maybe it's free.
