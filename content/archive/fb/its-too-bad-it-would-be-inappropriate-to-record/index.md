It's too bad it would be inappropriate to record video at the elementary school play ground or I would show you all the little munchkins playing tetherball. It goes like this:

One kid grabs the ball and hurls it. Then all six of them scream, duck, run, or dive to the ground. Once the ball slows a little, they swarm it and repeat. 

It is pretty adorable.
