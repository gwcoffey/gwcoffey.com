Sophie convinced us to watch the Netflix A Series of Unfortunate Events together and my verdict is that it is delightful. 

I read one of the books to the girls years ago and then they did several others but I never liked them much. It wasn't until years later when I heard Daniel Handler interviewed (and immediately sought out a few more of his interviews) that I realized embarrassingly that I really read the book wrong. I still haven't read the other books but he is great: a weird smart geeky one of a kind with a very distinct voice.

Anyway, I liked the show a lot.
