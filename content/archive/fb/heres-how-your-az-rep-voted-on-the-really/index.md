Here's how your AZ rep voted on the really despicable AHCA:

Voted YES:
* David Schweikert (District 6 / Scottsdale)
* Martha McSally (District 2 / Tucson)
* Paul Gosar (District 4 / Prescott)
* Trent Franks (District 8 / Glendale)

Voted NO:
* Kyrsten Sinema (District 9 / Phoenix)
* Ra√∫l Grijalva (District 3 / Yuma)
* Ruben Gallego (District 7 / Phoenix)
* Tom O'Halleran (District 1 / Sedona)

Voted NO because it wasn't drastic enough:
* Andy Biggs (District 5 / Gilbert)

Schweikert, McSally, and Franks are all vulnerable in 2018, so if that's your rep, you know what to do.
