I created a Facebook account in 2012 but didn't really post much until 2014. In 2018 I deleted my account (for secret reasons). It was a relief to let it go, but also a little sad. I quickly lost tabs of friends and extended family. Of course we still talk now and again, but I am much less aware of what's going on in their day to day lives. Nevertheless I'm glad I left.

In an act of unbridled vanity, I have archived all the old posts here.
