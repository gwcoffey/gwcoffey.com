One time a guy invited me to lunch and then on the way there he said he didn't have any cash with him and would I mind paying. And I said sure. And then when we got there the lady at the counter refused to serve us until he paid his unpaid bill from the last time he was there. So long story short he invited me to lunch and I ended up buying my lunch and buying two of his lunches. True story.
