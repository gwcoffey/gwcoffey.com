This is a great read about Apple Music.

I especially liked this bit from Eddy Cue about valuing the work of content creators:

{{< quote >}}
I’ve always felt that technology companies have disrespected the content creation process and the content creation people disrespect technology. Both think, 'How hard [could it be]?' The truth is … that both of them are artists when it comes down to it. A programmer starts with a blank screen, no different than starting a song with a blank sheet of paper.

Maybe sounds a bit like aggrandizing programming but in context it is clear what he means: Art is work and artists deserve to be valued and respected in the new world just as much as the engineers.
