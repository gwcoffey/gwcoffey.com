This conversation took place entirely via the Chase Bank "Secure Message Center":

Me: "I would like to close this account. I couldn't find a way to do that on line."

[2 days later]

Chase: "You cannot close an account on the web site. To close your account, call [phone number], send a letter to [address], or make the request via the Secure Message Centerâ„¢ on line."

Me: "I would like to close this account."

[2 days later]

Chase: "Your account is now closed."
