I hate that this headline style is leaking more and more into even the majors newspapers. 

It's not true at all that authorities "have no idea what it is."

Corrected: "A wolflike creature was stalking livestock in Montana. Authorities have not yet conclusively confirmed what it is."

(And I'm sure it'll turn out to be some kind of dog.)
