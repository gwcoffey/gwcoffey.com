This is a great time to share with you all what Rachel Ray told me when we were hanging out one time*. Put a blob of leftover stuffing in the waffle iron to reheat it. I took her advice last year and it was the greatest thing that ever happened to me. 

\* Don't tell her I told you. She's a very private person.
