{{< quote cite="Corrado Assenza, Italian pastry chef" >}}
I’ve chosen my path and I’ve followed it. Now I have no ambition. A life of simplicity, of quality. My family makes me happy and satisfied. I sleep well at night because I give the best of what I can do to those that come and taste what we make.
