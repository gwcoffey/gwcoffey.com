Somehow I got through 40+ years of life without knowing about Dar Williams. Isabel sent me a link to her beautiful song "When I was a Boy" a few months ago and I've been obsessing ever since. To me she's up there with John Prine as a songwriter. This one in particular is just a gem. I love everything about it.
