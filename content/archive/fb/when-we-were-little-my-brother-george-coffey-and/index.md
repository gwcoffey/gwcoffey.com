When we were little my brother, George Coffey and I shared a room. Sometimes while we were going to sleep at night he would say "You hear that plane? That could be about to drop a nuclear bomb. It could happen at any time and It would kill us all. In case it happens tonight, I want you to know I love you."

Good night, bro. Love you too.
