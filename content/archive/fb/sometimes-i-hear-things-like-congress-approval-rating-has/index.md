Sometimes I hear things like "Congress' approval rating has fallen to 9%" and I think, Who are these 9% and what in the world do they approve of? Does congress itself get like 27,000 votes in this poll or something?

Because really, I know anecdotal blah blah blah, but I don't know anybody who thinks congress is anything but a disaster at this point.
