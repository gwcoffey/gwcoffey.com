While we watch the AHCA fail to pass, the Muslim ban get blocked, and the soon-to-be budget fight, I would like to share with you this English language fun fact:

The word "check" meaning "to arrest the progress of something" comes to English *from* the game of chess (from Arabic no less), not the other way around. Chess predates the English language by perhaps 500 years.
