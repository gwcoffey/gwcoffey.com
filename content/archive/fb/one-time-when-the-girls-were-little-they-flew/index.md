One time when the girls were little they flew home from their Grandma's house by themselves. I told them the flight attendant would keep an eye on them the whole time and then send us a behavior report. 

A few years later Isabel asked me (somewhat skeptically) what the behavior report said because they had tried so hard to be good.

She looked scandalized when I told her I was lying. 

Ah, parenthood. It is one of my favorite things.
