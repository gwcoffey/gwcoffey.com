Actual work conversation between Dave Van Tassell and myself several weeks ago:

> Him: Oh the meeting is the week after the Super Bowl. That’ll make it easy to remember. 
> 
> Me: Oh the Super Bowl is the week before the meeting. That’ll make it easy to remember. 
> 
> Happy Super Bowl friends. I’m with you in spirit.
