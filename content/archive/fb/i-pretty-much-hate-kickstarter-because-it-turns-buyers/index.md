I pretty much hate kickstarter because it turns buyers into investors unwittingly and exposes them to risk without being clear about it. But I digress. I backed this because it is awesome. And I guess the people behind it are legit or whatever. Stupid kickstarter. But I want this movie to be real so if you agree, throw your money down the same deep dark hole I threw mine!
