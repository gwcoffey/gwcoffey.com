America, 2018

Trump tweets unsubstantiated garbage about "large scale killing" of white farmers in South Africa.

Republican Senator Bob Corker says he only tweeted it to "stimulate the base."

NBC's Frank Thorp asks what this means, what "base" would be stimulated by this kind of rhetoric.

Bob Corker: “Well, there are portions of those who support the president that are—I’m sure that generates excitement. I mean, it’s—you know what I’m saying...”

Yes we do bob. We've been saying it for years. Everybody knows it, on both sides. The question is if you care. But bob's got tax cuts to pass so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ let's stimulate the racists.
