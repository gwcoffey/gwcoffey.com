❤️ Leonard Cohen

{{< quote >}}{{< lines >}}
I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch

He said to me, "you must not ask for so much"

And a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door

She cried to me, "hey, why not ask for more?"

Like a bird on a wire
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free
