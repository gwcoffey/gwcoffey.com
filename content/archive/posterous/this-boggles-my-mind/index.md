I'm not sure making the world a worse place for everyone just because some loser didn't pay for Windows is a good idea... This is like a law that if someone steals they are no longer allowed to get vaccinations. Only in this alternate world, 80% of people steal, and so disease runs rampant. 

I mean I feel Microsoft's pain here. They experience more software theft than anyone else by a long shot. But in my opinion, every copy of windows should have up-to-date malware protection, period, because unprotected machines hurt everyone, not just the one using the machine. (Often, not the one using the machine at all really. [Conficker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conficker), for instance, actually makes your computer more secure if I remember correctly. And then uses it to attack everyone else.)

This was in Vista. Is this still how it works in Windows 7?
