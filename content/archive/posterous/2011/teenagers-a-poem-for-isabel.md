I wrote this for Isabel on their 13th birthday.

<blockquote>
<h2>Teenagers</h2>

Teenagers really aren’t so bad<br>
You still have plenty of hugs for dad<br>
You still laugh out loud<br>
You still hold my hand<br>
You still make me proud<br>
Still play in the sand<br>
The only real difference<br>
I now realize<br>
Is you’re one year older<br>
And you now roll your eyes
</blockquote>
