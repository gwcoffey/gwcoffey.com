Jesse was across the room with his bluetooth headset on:

JESSE: "Remind me to call Dog Ear on Friday"

ME: "I'm not your secretary. Put it in your calendar."

JESSE: "Actually, make it for two o'clock."

ME: "Ok, if you say so. I put it in my calendar so I can remind you, you disorganized hack."

JESSE: "Confirm."

ME: (confused) "Wait, are you talking to Siri?!"

JESSE: (to me this time) "What are you talking about?"

He was talking to Siri the whole time. I felt dumb.
