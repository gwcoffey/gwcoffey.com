[Sandra Day O'Connor][sandra] read this poem during her retirement speech. I got a kick out of it.

## There is No Indispensable Man

<blockquote>
Sometime when you're feeling important<br>
Sometime when your ego's in bloom<br>
Sometime when you take it for granted<br>
You're the best qualified in the room<br>

Sometime when you feel that your going<br>
Would leave an unfillable hole<br>
Just follow these simple instructions<br>
And see how they humble your soul<br>

Take a bucket and fill it with water<br>
Put your hand in it up to the wrist<br>
Pull it out and the hole that's remaining<br>
Is a measure of how you will be missed<br>

You can splash all you wish when you enter<br>
You may stir up the water galore<br>
But stop and you'll find that in no time<br>
It looks quite the same as before<br>

The moral of this quaint example<br>
Is do just the best that you can<br>
Be proud of yourself but remember<br>
There's no indispensable man<br>
<cite>Saxon N. White Kessinger, &copy;1959</cite>
