Pardon me while I indulge in the cuteness of my little 9 year old.

Transcription:

>JK Rowling:
>
>I love the book *Harry Potter*. They are my favorite books in the world. The books are way better than the movies.
>
>I did a report on you in school. I learned what JK stands for. It stands for Joanne Kathleen. I learned other stuff too. I want to meet you Miss Rowling. I gave you a colorful card because I don't know your favorite color.
>
>Just so you know, walnuts don't have teeth. Here, I will explain. In the first Harry Potter book when they go to The Leaky Cauldron and meet Tom the inn keeper you said he looked like a toothless walnut. It made me laugh. I also like your songs that at Hogwarts they sang.
>
>From Sophia

You have no idea how excited she was when I told her she could really write a letter to the real J.K. Rowling.
