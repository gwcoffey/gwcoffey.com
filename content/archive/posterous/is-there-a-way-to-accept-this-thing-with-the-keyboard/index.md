Mac OS X Lion does iPhone-style autocorrect as you type. I'm leaving it on for now to see if I like it. If it autocorrects something, you can press Escape to ignore the correction, but sometimes I'm typing and not paying attention, and a correction I don't want is applied. Like on the iPhone, you can back up to the word that was corrected and it will show a popup like the one below so you can quickly restore what you originally entered:

{{< figure 
	src="image.png" 
	height="60" 
	width="132" 
	alt="A screenshot of the auto-correct popup under entered text on Mac OS X." 
	caption="Auto-correct on the desktop." >}}
	
**Is there any way to accept this replacement with the keyboard?**

Anybody know?

Update: Thanks to my very special friend Dave Van Tassell for giving me the scoop. Use the arrow keys to select an item in the pop-up, and then the enter key to accept the one that's selected. So, in short, once the pop-up appears: {{< kbd char="â†“" >}} then {{< kbd char="Enter" >}}.
