I bought something on Amazon today and this promotional banner popped up:

{{< figure 
	src="image.jpg" 
	height="275" 
	width="470" 
	alt="An advertisemnt for \"the new swimshop\" showing a pale dead-faced woman in makeup photogaphed under water. Her hair floats strangely around her head." 
	caption="Inferi?" >}}
	
This immediately made me think of the Inferi from Harry Potter. Apparently Voldemort wants me to buy a swim suit. Creepy.
