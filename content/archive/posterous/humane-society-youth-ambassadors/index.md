Sophie and her friend Allison ran a fund raiser for the humane society this summer. They put on a "dog show" with the neighborhood dogs, complete with games, prizes, and homemade treats. Their goal was "101 donations" (aka, $101), which they handily beat.

They were then invited to participate in the Arizona Humane Society Telethon as "Youth Ambassadors." They had a blast!
