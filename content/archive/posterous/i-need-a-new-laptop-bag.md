My 8-year-old laptop backpack finally met its end last week, so I'm looking for a new one. I prefer a backpack style since I walk a lot with my laptop. I also really like the kind with a single across-the-chest strap because I find it hard to get both my ape-like arms out of a normal backpack without hurting my shoulders.

Vince has a great SwissGear backpack that I've always admired. I just ordered one, but it turns out they have removed the across-the-chest bit for some reason.

So anybody have any good suggestions? I may keep the one I have, but if I can find one with the chest thing that is very durable for around $100 or less, I'll probably give it a shot.

Thanks!
