I had to put this in some documentation I wrote for a client.

> Go Daddy will try very hard from now on to “up sell” you with additional names and services. You do not need to purchase other related names (and there is no benefit to you to do so unless you’re trying to protect a recognized brand) so avoid the extra check boxes. As you proceed, look for the “No Thanks” buttons, which will bypass all the unnecessary add-ons.

It is the truth.
