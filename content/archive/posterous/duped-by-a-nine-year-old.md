True story:

SOPHIA: [Loudly, to the room in general] What is 7 times 6? It isn't in my homework or anything, I'm just curious.

ME: [Distractedly while I work on my laptop] 42

SOPHIA: [cackles with glee, writes the answer on her homework sheet] Thank you!

This reminds me of another Sophia story worth recounting. When she was 4 years old, riding in the shopping cart at the grocery store. I turn down the alcohol aisle looking for cooking wine for a recipe.

SOPHIA: Eww. I don't like this stuff.

ME: I don't really like it either.

SOPHIA: [Curiously] Why not?

ME: It isn't good for you. 

SOPHIA: [Thinks for a minute] Actually, I do like this stuff.
