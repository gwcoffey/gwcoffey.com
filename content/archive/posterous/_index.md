[Posterous][post] was a blogging platform that made it easy to blog fron a mobile device. I really liked the simplicity of this site. It was much less fussy to edit and post than tools like WordPress and Blogger, and it supported custom domains. I used this for my personal blog for a few years  before it was acquired by Twitter and shut down.

Before it shut down I archived all my posts because I'm a digital hoarder.
