Sometimes I'm accused of being a good person, and I have to remind people that it *being evil* and *appearing evil* are only positively correlated for sufficiently small values of evil.

Here it is with some data points:

{{< figure 
	src="image-2.png" 
	height="407" 
	width="569" 
	alt="The same graph with some points labeled. Mid-way across and high on the appeaance of evil sits Apple. On the other side of the peak, Exxon. Google is all the way to the right." 
	caption="Evil corporations." >}}

Note, for instance, that Exxon is doing it wrong. They only need to be a little more evil to appear completely good. Google, on the other hand, totally has it figured out. Be *exceptionally* evil, and then actually declare that you are not evil. People believe that kind of crap. Apple, love 'em or hate 'em, is completely upfront about its evilness, which means, by definition, it isn't all that evil really.
