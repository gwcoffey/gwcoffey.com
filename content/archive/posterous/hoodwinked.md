SOPHIA: Will you read to me after dinner?

ME: Maybe.

SOPHIA: What?! Why maybe?

ME: Let me rest a bit and then get some stuff done and we'll see.

[…5 minutes pass…]

SOPHIA: Can we play 20 Questions while we eat?

ME: Sure.

SOPHIA: OK, you think of something first.

ME: OK, I'm thinking of something.

SOPHIA: Remember you have to answer "Yes" or "No".

ME: I'm well aware of the rules.

SOPHIA: OK, my first question is, will you read to me tonight?
