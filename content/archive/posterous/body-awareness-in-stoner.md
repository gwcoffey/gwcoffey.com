I love the novel *[Stoner][stoner]* by [John Williams][williams]. [*ed:* Since this was written I've read Williams' *Augustus* twice and it has become one of my favorite novels.] One thing I appreciated is the way Williams writes about Stoner's awareness of his physical self, especially his hands. 

[stoner]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoner_(novel)
[williams]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Edward_Williams

For example here where it seems to symbolize Stoner's anxiety:

<blockquote>
Stoner wet his lips and shifted on the chair. He tried to fold his large hands together so that they would be invisible.

</blockquote>

And here where it shows us something about his curiosity:

<blockquote>
Stoner became aware that his fingers were unclenching their hard grip on his desk-top. He turned his hands about under his gaze, marveling at their brownness, at the intricate way the nails fit into his blunt finger-ends; he thought he could feel the blood flowing invisibly through the tiny veins and arteries, throbbing delicately and precariously from his fingertips through his body.

</blockquote>

There are several passages like this, revealing Stoner's interior self through his observation of his exterior self. Good stuff.
