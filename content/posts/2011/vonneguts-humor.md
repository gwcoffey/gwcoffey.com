I've been a [Vonnegut][v] fan since I was in high school. Of course there's a lot to like about his work. But one thing I'll mention here is his dry humor. This, for example, is one of the greatest things ever written:

<blockquote>
Billy had a framed prayer on his office wall which expressed his method for keeping going, even though he was unenthusiastic about living. A lot of patients who saw the prayer on Billyâ€™s wall told him that it helped them to keep going, too. It went like this: GOD GRANT ME THE SERENITY TO ACCEPT THE THINGS I CANNOT CHANGE, COURAGE TO CHANGE THE THINGS I CAN, AND WISDOM ALWAYS TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE.

<strong>Among the things Billy Pilgrim could not change were the past, the present, and the future</strong>.
