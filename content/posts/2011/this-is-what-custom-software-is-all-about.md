>I took a phone call for the dreaded DUPLICATE CARD REQUEST!!! In the past this has been one of the most time consuming, aggravating and plain worst thing to do. BUT!!!!
>
> I was able to pull up the students name, run her credit card, and generate and email a receipt to her all without leaving my desk. I did have to move to get the card out of the drawer to print her new card.
>
> In the past we would have to get all this done by visiting the archive, looking up the persons name, and hoping they have an idea, when & where they took the class, then we would run the credit card, print the card, mail the receipt , card. This was time consuming and not always were we able to help the student out.
>
> NOW we can do so much more in such a short amount of time. Carl has done wonders with the web site, and has taken our ideas and made them work. Bonnie has put into place the steps to GET THIS DONE! [...]

> So KUDO's to all who have been a part of this process in making [this] a great and wonderful place to work (and PLAY)
