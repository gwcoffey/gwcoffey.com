I wrote this poem for Isabel's friend, who was collecting poems about Guinea Pigs for a project:

<blockquote>
Guinea Pig, O’ Guinea Pig<br>
I have bad news for thee

Tho’ your name is Guinea Pig<br>
You are no pig to me

For pigs are big, and round, and snort<br>
And dig all day in dirt<br>
But all you ever seem to do<br>
Is pee upon my shirt

Pigs, what's more, make bacon crisp<br>
A truly perfect food<br>
But bacon from a Guinea Pig<br>
Is never very good

Guinea Pig, O’ Guinea Pig<br>
You furry little friend<br>
I'm glad you don't belong to me<br>
For I would be your end
</blockquote>
