I use Siri to text my wife when I leave work to let her know I'm on my way. It is super handy and saves me about 15 seconds every day, which appeals to my inner lazy. Unfortunately, although Siri is very good, she's by no means human. I occasionally throw her off by being too informal. The other day this conversation took place:

ME: Siri, text my wife and tell her I'm on my way home now.

SIRI: Here's your message to Mamie Coffey. Ready to send it?

ME: Read it to me.

SIRI: Your message to Mamie Coffey says, "I'm on my way home now." Would you like to send, cancel, review, or change it? 

ME: Send it, my friend.

SIRI: Geoff, I don't know who your friend is. Who should I send it to?

ME: My wife.

SIRI: Ok, I can send a text to Mamie Coffey for you. What would you like it to say?

ME: Oh Siri, you can't be serious.

SIRI: Here's your message to Mamie Coffey: "Oh Siri, you can't be serious." Ready to send it?

Yes, Siri, please send it.

PS: On a related note, when Siri asks a yes or no question, she does not understand "Engage" to mean yes. I consider this a failing. She does, however, accept "Make it so," so not all hope is lost.
