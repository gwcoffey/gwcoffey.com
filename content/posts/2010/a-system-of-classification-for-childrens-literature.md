I've come to the realization that all childrenâ€™s literature can be classified quite neatly into just a few simple categories. My proposed system of classification follows.

An adolescent human, or sometimes anthropomorphized animal or (rarely) toaster who is an outcast in his or her family, community, or peer group discovers, through an unexpected adventure, something fantastic about him- or herself or the world, often providing aid to others in the process.

## Type 2: Savior Spider

A benevolent but short-lived spider, through clever manipulation of the human psyche, saves the life of a humble pig.
