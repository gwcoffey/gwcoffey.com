And I\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of the 20th century\u0026rsquo;s first and biggest bad girl, Mary MacLane. And I\u0026rsquo;m a computer programmer. So I suppose this was inevitable…\nI give you, the Mary MacLane Bot on Mastodon, a bot that posts random curated passages from Mary MacLane\u0026rsquo;s I Await the Devil\u0026rsquo;s Coming every four hours.\nWho is Mary MacLane Mary MacLane\u0026rsquo;s writing is hard to classify, but I\u0026rsquo;ll try: self-absorbed, honest, irreverent, hyper-dramatic, funny, sad, beautiful, and personal. She wrote her debut memoir, I Await the Devil\u0026rsquo;s Coming, as a sort of diary over a period of three months in 1901, at just 19 years old. It begins:\nI of womankind and of nineteen years, will now begin to set down as full and frank a Portrayal as I am able of myself, Mary MacLane, for whom the world contains not a parallel.\nIt then it just goes.\nShe came to me late in life. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how I discovered her work, but the moment I did, maybe five years ago, I was hooked. (My kids will tell you this is unsurprising because I have something of a fascination with so-called \u0026ldquo;badly behaved women\u0026rdquo; and Mary certainly fills that niche.)\nI think the thing I love most about her writing is that it pulls no punches. In some sense she\u0026rsquo;s the quintessential teenager, for whom everything is somehow simultaneously overwhelming and entirely possible.\nI love her pleading prose. I love her dry humor. I love her strangeness in all its forms. Some people are turned off by her ego. Some by her irreverence. Some by her dramatics. (And some, of course because she\u0026rsquo;s bisexual.) But I love her. I love her not in spite of these things but because of them.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve posted a sample chapter here if you\u0026rsquo;d like to get a sense of her prose style, humor, and dramatics.\nMary put her full authentic self into her writing. As she says in her entry on April 13, I have given my heart into the keeping of this. And now I give it to you.\nTechnical Details The bot is implemented in TypeScript. The source code is available on GitHub, and the bot is available as an NPM module called @gwcoffey/litbot. This is a somewhat generic module for selecting at random from a dataset of text passages and posting it to Mastodon.\nI curated the data for MacLane Bot myself using the plain text version of I Await the Devil\u0026rsquo;s Coming from Project Gutenberg. I am, as always, grateful for the Project Gutenberg volunteers for the valuable work they do.\nNote: The Project Gutenberg version of the book carries the title The Story of Mary MacLane. This is the original publication title because Mary\u0026rsquo;s preferred title was considered too provocative. MacLane Bot itself is executed periodically as a Netlify scheduled function. The code for the function and the raw passage data is in the GitHub repo for this website but I\u0026rsquo;m not going to link to it here\u0026mdash;it is so much more fun to follow the bot and get little jolts of joy throughout the day.\nThe MacLane Bot Mastodon account is graciously hosted free of charge on the botsin.space instance.\n","img":true,"link":"/posts/maclane-bot/","tags":["Project"],"title":"Mary MacLane Bot on Mastodon"},{"content":"Sometimes I get very bad puns stuck in my head. And sometimes, to debride my wounded mind, I draw them poorly.\nI use \u0026ldquo;draw\u0026rdquo; lightly here. I have a very unsteady hand and no sense of perspective. Typically I make a rough photo-collage of whatever I have in mind, then trace in Procreate with an Apple Pencil.

And it seemed so corny and over the top.\nAnd then we grew up, had kids, and sent them to school and holy cow it seems like all that corny stuff actually worked. I mean bullying is certainly still a problem, but at least for my kids, school was so dramatically different than I remembered: Kindness was no longer uncool. Kids complimented each other. They befriended kids with disabilities and showed them real acceptance. They cheered the uncoordinated kids when they tried to climb the rope. They made an effort to include the lonely kids. Every time I went to their school I was simply amazed. At first I thought it was just their magical elementary school, but they both moved on to different middle and high school and the kindness continued. Certainly there were hurt feelings and occasional nastiness, but by and large these kids were good to each other. Like the bullies of the world just get less oxygen now so far fewer act out.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t help but wonder what Trump-style politics is doing to all this. Giving oxygen to the would-be-bullies is what.

The stars will collide forming a black hole, an explosion of energy, and a hot expanding cloud of matter.\nGather the cloud of matter and, using a centrifuge, sort it by density.\nThis process should yield about 20,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 ounces of pure gold (on today’s market that is worth about $20,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 if you can find a buyer).\nYou may discard the remaining black hole, or save for later.

It has been a source of frustration that his work is hard to find. The Ebooks that are available are all direct Gutenberg transfers rife with errors, terrible formatting, and a total lack of care. It makes it very hard to share this beautiful work with people I think might enjoy it. This is something I\u0026rsquo;ve wanted to fix for a long time.\nThen last week I caught wind of the Standard Ebooks project. This is like a hobby custom tailored for me: a mashup of programming, markup, open source, and the public domain. I hooked up with the Standard Ebooks folks and as my first production (hopefully of many), using their platform, we produced a really beautiful ebook version of Tagore\u0026rsquo;s Gitanjali with quality typography, subject-appropriate cover art, and careful editing. And of course it is entirely free in both senses of the word.\nThis makes me very very happy. If you love beautiful lyrical moving poetry OR if you have an e-reader and believe information was meant to be free, check it out! (And of course if you spot any problems with the book let me know or fork the repo and submit a pull request 🤓)\nLink\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/fb/i-made-a-thing-im-a-huge-fan-of/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":""},{"content":"lol Russia.

That Republicans have unilaterally undermined that protection. This is baloney.\n(My primary source is: Link )\nThe filibuster allows a minority party in the senate to undermine progress through “dilatory” debate: debate only for the purpose of delay, rather than persuasion.\nIt was not designed by the founders. It was not created to protect minorities. It was not instituted by careful legislative procedure to serve a higher purpose.\nIt was an accident.\nHow did we get to where we are today, where a minority party can significantly derail the entire legislative agenda of the majority, even when the majority controls the house, the senate, and the presidency?\nSit back and I will tell you…\nThe Constitution is deliberately open-ended about congressional procedure. It is covered in Article I Section 5, and this is the relevant clause:\n“Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings”\nThe House and the Senate themselves are Constitutionally empowered to decide how, exactly, they will operate individually.\nThe Constitution says nothing about “cloture”, “filibuster”, or even motions, debates, and voting procedures.\nSomething called “parliamentary procedure” was well understood at the time, and the houses of Congress, in the absence of other rules, operate under this procedure. Which means, among other things, “majority rules.”\nWe can safely assume this because when the constitution does care about super-majorities, it is always explicit. For example:\nOn expelling a member for bad behavior:\n“Each House may…with the Concurrence of two-thirds, expel a Member.”\nOn overriding a presidential veto:\n“shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives”\nOn impeachment and conviction of a federal officer:\n“no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present”\nExcept in the six cases where the constitution explicitly requires a super-majority in congress, a simple majority is assumed.\nFor example, as you know, it requires a simple majority in each house to pass a law (which the president may veto).\nWhen the first Senate convened in 1787, one of the first orders of business was to establish the “Rules of its Proceedings” as authorized by the constitution.\nAfter some debate, the Senate settled on 20 rules, most of which are very dry and boring. One was the “previous question” rule:\n“The previous question being moved and seconded, the question for the chair shall be: ’Shall the main question now be put?’ and if the nays prevail, the main question shall not then be put.”\nIt allowed any Senator to make a motion for “the previous question” meaning they suggest debate be ended and the original question under debate be considered.\nUnless a simple majority of Senators disagreed (“if the nays prevail”), debate would end.\nUltimately these rules are interpreted and enforced by the president of the Senate.\n(An office filled by the Vice President of the United States.)\nIn 1806, then Vice President Aaron Burr suggested that some of the rules were unnecessary. In particular he pointed out that the “previous question” rule had only been used one time in the prior four years.\nObviously, he argued, the rule wasn’t really necessary.\nThe rule was removed, and as an oversight, the Senate failed to implement any new rule to terminate debate.\nAt that moment it became theoretically possible for one Senator to perpetuate debate for as long as he or she had the stamina, blocking all Senate progress in the process.\n(The racist Strom Thurmond famously demonstrated this when he spoke for 24 hours and 18 minutes straight to block the Civil Rights act.)\nBut we know Burr was not arguing for this power. Filibusters didn’t really enter anybody’s mind at the time.\nThe idea of using “dilatory” tactics to delay procedure was considered undignified. As Senator Clifford Case explained, “the body observed dignity and restraint in debate, and did not consider talking to consume time a parliamentary instrument appropriate for the Senate”\nAnd this is supported by this simple fact:\nIt never once happened for more than 30 years. Not until 1837 did the first Senator filibuster, when a small group of Senators loyal to Andrew Jackson blocked all action in the Senate until the censure of Jackson was removed from the Senate record.\nOther minority groups in the Senate obviously took notice. By 1841, the Senate realized it had a problem. It began trying to undo the filibuster.\nSenate heavyweights like Henry Clay argued forcefully for the “previous question” rule to be reinstated, restoring majority control of the Senate.\nBut the existence of the filibuster itself made the rule change difficult. A small minority of Senators could bring all business in the Senate to a halt rather than allow the the rule change to be voted on.\nThe Senate was stymied by the filibuster for 75 more years, as the practice grew and grew.\nFinally the dam broke in 1917. President Woodrow Wilson, responding to legitimate threats from Axis powers, proposed a bill allowing the arming of American merchant ships to defend themselves from attack.\nThe bill was supported by the President, the House, the Senate, and the American people.\nBut 11 pacifist members of the Senate filibustered, effectively blocking passage of the bill.\n(They believed — correctly — that it was a small step toward American involvement in World War I.)\nThis caused something of an outrage.\nWilson was mad.\n(Although he got what he wanted anyway by executive order).\nThe Senate leadership was mad.\nAnd American voters were mad.\nThis produced the right political environment to finally reform the senate rules.\nBut how to do it?\nSpoiler: In politics, where there\u0026rsquo;s political will, there\u0026rsquo;s a way.\nThis, 1917, is when what we now call the “nuclear option” first came into play. At the time it was called the “constitutional option”.\n(It is probably more correct to say the Nuclear Option is the application of the Constitutional Option to force cloture with a simple majority vote, but they are closely related.)\nSeveral Senators including the venerable Henry Cabot Lodge and Thomas Walsh suggested that this situation was unconstitutional.\nRemember the Constitution says simply:\n“Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings”\nAnd it is understood that such determinations are by simple majority. As Senator Walsh eloquently put it:\n“A majority may adopt the rules, in the first place. It is preposterous to assert that they may deny future majorities the right to change them.”\nLegally, he argued, a Senate in session in 1806 had passed, by simple majority, a rule change which now prevented a simple majority from changing the rules. But the Constitution clearly indicates that the majority in the Senate makes the rules.\nHis argument was more complex than this, but this is the gist:\nThe Senate acting alone cannot amend or overrule the Constitution. So a past Senate majority cannot deny future Senate majorities their Constitutionally guaranteed rights.\nCritical to this maneuver was the idea that the rules were not yet in play. Otherwise, even considering his interpretation would be open to debate and filibuster.\nWalsh argued that the Senate is not a continuous body. Rather, in each term, a new Senate convenes. At that moment, it has no established rules.\nAnd so it is operating under those well-understood parliamentary rules.\nFor the prior 111 years, each new Senate had de facto adopted the prior Senate’s rules, but, he argued, they are under no obligation to do so forever.\nThis is not as radical as it sounds. The House, for instance, has operated this way since 1860. Every time a new term of the House of Representatives convenes, their first order of business is to write their rules for the session.\n(Which usually involves adopting the old rules.)\nThis produced a long-running legal debate about the nature of the Senate.\nIs the Senate a continuous body, operating from 1787 to the present?\nOr have we had 115 Senates, each convened for a term?\nThis argument is delicious\u0026hellip;\nIn the House, every member is re-elected and sworn in every term.\nSo it is reasonable to call it a new legislative body each term.\nBut in the Senate, only 1/3rd of its members are re-elected every term.\nThe other 2/3rds still have two or four years left on their six year terms.\nWalsh’s opponents argued that this difference made the Senate one continuous body.\nWhile of course the members had completely changed many times over since 1787, just like the Ship of Theseus, the Senate itself remained whole and original.\nLink (See also George Washington\u0026rsquo;s Axe.)\nThis argument is still not fully resolved. The Senate has argued this (as part of its Constitutional Option debates) for 100 years, and has always avoided declaring itself one way or the other.\nIn 1917 a compromise was reached. The Constitutional Option was not invoked, but the Senate agreed without filibuster to its first “cloture” rule, the famous Rule XXII.\nAt the time, this rule allowed a 2/3rds majority of present Senators to force the end of debate.\nWalsh wanted simple majority.\nThe minority members wanted the status quo.\nBut facing the threat of the Constitutional Option they compromised.\nFor the next 100 years, this rule, the Constitutional Option, and the idea of cloture would be revisited dozens of times.\nOver and over again, minorities in the Senate would use the filibuster dramatically to block popular civil rights reforms that were repugnant to their small constituencies, mostly in the south.\nTime and time again the Senate majority would grow weary of this obstructionism and try to undermine the filibuster.\nTime and time again, minority parties would try to bolster the filibuster.\nIn 1949 rule XXII changed from 2/3rds of present senators, to 2/3rds of all Senators making filibusters a little harder to break.\nIn 1957 it changed back.\nAll along, certain Senators used the threat of the Constitutional Option to encourage compromise.\n“If you won’t cooperate, please note that we can just go around you if we really want to. It is our Constitutional right.”\nTensions grew as the progressive agendas of the 1960s and 70s were continually undermined by Senate minorities.\nLiberals wanted one thing: To weaken the filibuster by requiring 3/5ths vote for cloture instead of 2/3rds. But they were thwarted repeatedly.\nIt can be argued that over the long run the filibuster primarily benefits conservatives because by definition is obstructs progress.\n“By 1975, the liberal bloc had devoted twenty-two years and multiple failed attempts to three-fifths cloture reform.“\nBut in 1975 the landscape changed significantly because of yet another rule change.\nThe Senate in 1975 adopted a “two track” process for legislation.\nThe goal of this change was to reduce the negative impact of filibuster on the Senate itself.\nInstead of considering only one legislation at a time, the Senate could consider two.\nIn practice, one bill could be actively being filibustered while a pipeline of other bills sailed through.\nPrior to this rule, when a minority party decided to filibuster, they really mucked up everything. The entire Senate came to a standstill.\nThe Senate could break the filibuster if it had the votes. Or it could accomplish nothing. Or it could give in to the filibuster and table the opposed question.\nThis was increasingly disruptive to the Senate as a whole, so they introduced the two track system with the best intentions.\nUnfortunately, this had two problematic consequences:\n1. It made filibuster less politically costly. A minority party could filibuster one bill without blocking a popular agenda and incurring the wrath of the People.\n2. It made filibuster easier. Now you really only had to say “I’m gonna filibuster”. The Senate would move to track two and you didn’t actually have to go all Mr. Smith Goes to Washington on the bill.\nThe practical result of this rule change was about a 3x increase in use of the filibuster.\nIt became clear that passing any legislation required a 2/3rds majority of the Senate rather than the simple majority the Constitution intended.\nThis provided enough impetus for the Senate to finally get over its fear of the Constitutional Option.\nIn 1975, on three occasions throughout months of complex procedural wrangling, the Senate president affirmed the Constitutional Option.\nThe Senate had the power, by simple majority, to rewrite its own rules.\n(Aside: This kind of ruling forms a binding precedent in the Senate. A precedent that still stands today.)\nBut the majority in the Senate didn’t do away with the filibuster entirely. Rather than re-institute the previous question rule, they simply tightened the requirements for filibuster a little bit.\nInstead of a 2/3rds majority for cloture, rule XXII now requires a 3/5ths majority.\nThere were other procedural fights in the Senate in the following years, primarily limiting use of the filibuster in certain scenarios.\nBut in general the rule stood.\nBut by 2000 we had a nation narrowly divided along party lines. The Senate became closely divided.\nWe had a contested presidential race in Bush v Gore, and a lot of opposition to the president’s agenda by the Democrats.\nWhen the Democrats lost control of the Senate, they began to use the filibuster more aggressively to obstruct the Republican agenda.\nThis was taken to even greater extremes during the Obama presidency.\nThe majority leader in the Senate famously said his number one priority was to “make Obama a one term president.”\nNot to advance a conservative agenda. Not to reign in the president’s liberal agenda. Not to find acceptable compromises. Not to refuse to yield on matters of principle. But simply to undermine Obama’s popularity by making him appear ineffective so he wouldn’t be reelected.\nAnd thus we entered the modern era of the filibuster, where the minority party blocks all legislation and appointments as a matter of principle.\nRemember when in 1806 dilatory procedures were considered undignified? Beneath the dignity of the esteemed Senate?\nWe’ve come a long way baby.\nThe Democrats put a nail in the filibuster coffin by revising the rules to allow simple majority cloture for judicial nominations other than for the Supreme Court.\nThe Republicans cried foul.\nNow the Democrats are the slim minority in the Senate and they have adopted the same filibuster practice.\nAnd this week the Senate put one more nail in the coffin. Now the filibuster can’t be used against Supreme Court nominees either.\nYou’ll read a lot this week about how this is a huge step. How it is a violation of the founding principles. How it is unprecedented.\nAll of that is wrong.\nThe filibuster was an accident.\nYou can argue that it serves an important purpose. But I would argue that it has only undermined the Senate recently. And even historically, the big filibusters have so often been in opposition to good legislation. (None of this is to say that the Merick Garland nomination situation wasn’t a problem. I’m separating Garland’s nomination from my opposition to the filibuster in general.)\nWe still have the filibuster for legislation. I’m not sure how much longer it will last.\nBut when it falls, and you read about how it has destroyed the storied dignity of the senate…\nRemember the history.\n.\n(I\u0026rsquo;m not a historian. Just a person who likes history.

The common thread is that this is a democracy, he won, and conservatives felt the same way about Obama, so people should stop complaining.\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s not the same thing.\nIf, during the 2008 campaign, Obama had said \u0026ldquo;White people, they\u0026rsquo;re not the best people. They enslaved us. They rape us. They shoot us down. And some of them, I assume, are good people\u0026rdquo;, you might have a hint of what some people are feeling.\nIf, during the 2008 campaign, Obama had said \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m calling for a total and complete shutdown of Christians entering America. Studies show 35% of christians think gays and lesbians should be punished. Without looking at the polls, it is obvious to anyone that their hatred is beyond comprehension. Until we understand where their hate comes from, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Homophobia, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life,\u0026rdquo; you might have a hint of what some people are feeling.\nIf, during the 2008 campaign, Obama had said, when asked about dealing with Christian citizens, \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re going to have to do certain things that were frankly unthinkable a year ago,\u0026rdquo; you might have a hint of what some people are feeling.\nIf, during the 2008 campaign, Obama had said \u0026ldquo;Radical White Christianity is at the root of the KKK, lynchings, slavery, and attacks against feminism and the LGBTQ community. We need to tell the truth about radical white christianity, and John McCain won\u0026rsquo;t even use the word. What is he afraid of? He hasn\u0026rsquo;t even said he\u0026rsquo;s not a christian.\u0026rdquo; you might have a hint of what some people are feeling.\nI say \u0026ldquo;a hint\u0026rdquo; because of course Obama would never have been elected if he had said these things. You don\u0026rsquo;t get elected by spewing hate at the ruling class. And until a week ago, it had been 70+ years since someone in this country could be elected by spewing hate so openly at any minority group.\nAnd also, of course, we are not as familiar with the language of hate as those who have experienced it first hand, so we\u0026rsquo;re less attuned to it, less impacted by it. Even hearing a president say those things about us wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be as frightening to us, because we don\u0026rsquo;t fear that those words will become actions. Perhaps in Trump\u0026rsquo;s case they won\u0026rsquo;t but it is ridiculous to dismiss concerns by some groups that they may.\nWhen you suggest that people who respond negatively to these kinds of words used by a president against their own communities are whining, you imply that the only difference between Donald Trump and, say, Barack Obama is substantive policy disagreements. Buried in that is the assumption that Trump\u0026rsquo;s racism doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. And that is why it is accurate to say you are \u0026ldquo;normalizing\u0026rdquo; racism and bigotry. You\u0026rsquo;re saying racism isn\u0026rsquo;t really important and when people act like it is their response is invalid.\nYou may despise Obama. That\u0026rsquo;s your prerogative. But he never gave you any legitimate reason to think he despises you, or people like you. That\u0026rsquo;s a terribly important distinction.\nHave a little heart for the girls who were told by their president that all they are is \u0026ldquo;a piece of ass\u0026rdquo;.\nHave a little heart for the immigrants who were told by their president that they are ruining our country, and that they are not a great kind of people.\nHave a little heart for the muslims who were told by their president that people who share their religion are unfit to even enter the country\nHave a little heart for those with disabilities who were bullied and made fun of from the pulpit by their president because they struggle with language or motor control.\nHave a little heart for the victims of sexual abuse who had to listen to their president laugh about how he can \u0026ldquo;grab them by the pussy\u0026rdquo; any time he wants because he\u0026rsquo;s rich and powerful.\nHave a little heart for the POWs and their families who were told by their president that only losers get captured.\nHave a little heart for the protesters who, in the face of all this, when they chose to express their distaste for his behavior, were told that they are \u0026ldquo;professional protesters incited by the media\u0026rdquo; and that their protest is \u0026ldquo;unfair!\u0026rdquo; by the most powerful man in the world.\nHave a little heart for the parents who don\u0026rsquo;t love the idea of a president who brags about the size of his penis in public, and threatens to sodomize those who disagree with him.\nHave a little heart. I only ask that you have a little bit. Just enough to understand where your neighbors are coming from. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to agree with them, but if you can\u0026rsquo;t even bring yourself to understand their concern, then shame on you.\nThere are lots of reasons people voted for Donald Trump. It is wrong to suggest that everyone who voted for him is a racist or a bigot. But it is not wrong to point out that by voting for him, we decided his overt racism didn\u0026rsquo;t matter enough to disqualify him. It is obvious and expected that the communities who were a target of his hate speech would be upset by that result.\nBe happy that Trump was elected. Be happy that your policy preferences may see increased acceptance in government. Be happy that your man won the election. But have just a shred of empathy to realize that the other half of Donald Trump, the half so many of us were opposed to, is just as real, and that half is a hateful, foul mouthed man who used divisive language to rally support from some of the darkest corners of our country. Have enough empathy to understand why the targets of that speech have legitimate concerns. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to hate your neighbor to appreciate your president.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/fb/its-not-the-same-thing-i-see-so-many/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":""},{"content":"It\u0026rsquo;s true.

Let\u0026rsquo;s not forget that.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s the thing.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to dig deep, consult shady sources, lean on cultural bias, and trust dysphemistic partisan summaries of thousand page reports to spot Trump\u0026rsquo;s evil.\nYou only have to listen to him speak.\nAnd watch him move.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t need to decipher hidden clues to know he\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;Mocks a physically disabled reporter like the worst of the worst eighth grade bully.\n\u0026hellip;Denigrates a distinguished American war hero who was tortured repeatedly and spent five years as a prisoner of war.\n\u0026hellip;Proposes an outright ban on immigrants based on their faith and/or ethnicity.\n\u0026hellip;Disparages millions of Mexican immigrants based only on their nation of origin.\n\u0026hellip;Argues for the deliberate murder of innocent family members of our military enemies.\n\u0026hellip;Verbally attacks numerous American citizens openly and publicly because they disagree with his politics.\n\u0026hellip;Insists an American Judge is unfit to serve because of his parents\u0026rsquo; ethnic heritage.\n\u0026hellip;Brags about the size of his penis during a televised debate.\n\u0026hellip;Disparages the physical appearance of his political opponent\u0026rsquo;s wife.\n\u0026hellip;Boasts about his ability to sexually assault women at will.\n\u0026hellip;Promotes a view of America rooted in fear, hatred, and anger.\n\u0026hellip;Lies openly and brazenly about easily verifiable facts.\n\u0026hellip;Resorts to base xenophobia to explain away crime, climate change, and every other difficult problem.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to like Clinton. But to suggest that she \u0026ldquo;just as bad\u0026rdquo; as Trump is frankly ridiculous.\nDonald Trump is not fit to share my dinner table, let alone be our president.\nAnd I say this as a person who spoke strongly against Bill Clinton\u0026rsquo;s impropriety when he was president. And who was not a Bush supporter but spoke out routinely against the over the top anti-Bush rhetoric coming from the left.\nTrump is different.\nHe is awful.\nAll I\u0026rsquo;m trying to say is\u0026hellip;\nIf you think Clinton and Trump are equivalent—both evil—you\u0026rsquo;re wrong.\nClinton is somewhere between typical-politician and more-than-average-opportunist depending on how willing you are to trust highly partisan interpretations of her political enemies.\n(Or she\u0026rsquo;s evil if you believe utter bull.)\nTrump is clearly, by his own words, right in front of your face, indisputably horrible.\nThese are not the same thing.\nVote for Clinton.\nVote for Johnson.\nVote for McMullin.\nVote for Stein.\nOr write in someone else.\nBut for the love of all things we hold dear as a nation and a species\u0026hellip;\nPlease don\u0026rsquo;t vote for Trump.\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/listapp/lesser-of-two-evils/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Lesser of Two Evils"},{"content":"Sophia thinks I took too long to get home.

You can prove it to yourself the next time you see a huge full moon rising. Just hold out your thumb at arms length and note how big the moon is in comparison. Then later in the night when the moon is high and tiny, do it again. It will be the same size in relation to your thumb even though it looks tiny up there.\nThis fact debunks some of the older \u0026ldquo;explanations\u0026rdquo; for the Moon Illusion like magnification from the atmosphere. Clearly the illusion is all in your head.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve read explanations a dozen times over the years and honestly they never felt very sensible.\n\u0026ldquo;We perceive the sky as flat and so [words]\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;When compared to buildings and trees it seems bigger because [words]\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nI was reading about the Illusion in Wikipedia the other day and a little note in one of their possible explanations finally clicked for me. It seems so right that it has become my official favorite.\nHere goes\u0026hellip;\nWe have no real bearing to comprehend the size and shape of the sky. It is just big and largely empty. It is hard to tell what is close and what is far away because the things in the sky aren\u0026rsquo;t things we interact with.\nVs, e.g., cars way down the road. You have a very good sense of how big that car really is.\nThe one thing we do have a decent intuitive sense of is clouds.\nWe see them in the sky all the time. We may not have a clear sense of their absolute size, but we do know this:\nWhen they\u0026rsquo;re right over head they look big. As they recede to the horizon they appear smaller and smaller.\nThis fits our intuitive sense of the world. Everything we see looks smaller when it is farther away.\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s a convincing model of the sky.\nAnd it fits factual reality. Clouds are around 100 times further away from us on the horizon vs directly overhead.\nThey aren\u0026rsquo;t very high up.\nAnd their apparent size is correspondingly smaller.\nThis gives us an intuitive sense of the sky, of how things behave in the sky, even though we aren\u0026rsquo;t good at guessing exactly how far away objects in the sky actually are.\nAnd there\u0026rsquo;s the rub\u0026hellip;\nThe Moon high in the sky is, for all practical purposes, no closer than the moon on the horizon.\nBecause the moon is very very very high up.\nSo the actual apparent size of the moon does not get smaller as it approaches the horizon.\nBut our sense of the sky makes us think it should. Just like clouds and airplanes and hot air balloons and everything else we see in the sky.\nConsequently when we see the moon way out there on the horizon, it seems like it must be bigger. High in the sky it should have grown closer but it didn\u0026rsquo;t grow at all so it seems smaller.\nI think some other factors also contribute, like comparison to distant objects and reduced contrast making minute details easier to see clearly. But I think this is the primary driver of our perception of size.\n🌕\n\u0026ldquo;In that exalted-humbling moment of pure delight I felt myself at once both small and great.\u0026rdquo; — Dr. Faust\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/listapp/the-moon-illusion/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"The Moon Illusion"},{"content":"Uber + Self Driving Cars + Food Trucks.\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/fb/uber-self-driving-cars-food-trucks/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":""},{"content":"A fascinating (although poorly written) look at how tracing a gun to it\u0026rsquo;s owner works considering the ATF is not allowed to use computers to search the records.\nLink\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/fb/a-fascinating-although-poorly-written-look-at-how-tracing/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":""},{"content":"Having family movie night at home without Isabel for the first time.

Inspired by: Link\n1: Take out your credit or debit card.\n2: Open the \u0026ldquo;Wallet\u0026rdquo; app on your iPhone.\n3: Tap the (+) button in the top-right corner.\nThe camera comes on.\n4: Aim your phone at your card so it lines up with the guide.\nThis is a shake shack gift card but you should use a real credit card instead.\n5: Follow the steps on-screen to verify the card.\nThe exact process varies by bank. For my Bank of America cards I get a text message with a code. For my American Express they called me.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it. You\u0026rsquo;re ready to pay with your phone.\nNow at the store, just hold your phone against the credit card terminal and rest your finger on the fingerprint reader.\nIf the terminal supports mobile payments, you\u0026rsquo;ll see a picture of your card appear along with the fingerprint icon. After a second or two it will beep confirmation and you\u0026rsquo;re done.\n(It takes a little getting used to, especially with the social pressure of the line. You might want to practice somewhere you know it is accepted.)\nNote: Most stores that accept Apple Pay don\u0026rsquo;t actually have a sign anywhere. You will usually see an icon like this. But some terminals work even without the icon. In a vast majority of cases if their terminal has a chip card slot it will also take Apple Pay.\nAnd it only takes a second to check. Just hold your phone to the terminal once it\u0026rsquo;s ready to take payment. If you don\u0026rsquo;t see your card pop up, then you\u0026rsquo;ll know it\u0026rsquo;s not supported and you can pull out the plastic card and fight the chip card battle.\nApple Pay does not require internet access or data service to use. It\u0026rsquo;ll work just fine even if you\u0026rsquo;re in the middle of nowhere with no service. All communication is between the phone and the terminal.\nPaying with Apple Pay is much more secure than using a swipe card. Your phone knows your card information (stores securely) and it generates a one-time code to send to the terminal for each purchase. The store never knows your name, card number, etc so even if they\u0026rsquo;re hacked (see Target) your account is perfectly safe.\nYou can use Apple Pay in apps like Uber and Lyft as well. You just use your fingerprint to authorize payment and don\u0026rsquo;t have to save a card on file with each company.\nYou can add multiple cards to your wallet. When you do, you\u0026rsquo;ll pick the \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; card that will be used when you hold your phone to the terminal. To switch cards, double-tap the home button instead.\nYou can also use Apple Pay from your Apple Watch. Add the card in the Watch App, then double-tap the side button to bring up the card, and tap to pay. You can pay with it even if you don\u0026rsquo;t have your phone with you (like when you\u0026rsquo;re out exercising).\nBank of America is rolling out ATMs that work with Apple Pay. At my local bank I can withdraw money or make deposits without having to insert my card. I just hold my watch up to the ATM and then enter my PIN.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/listapp/how-to-set-up-apple-pay/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"How To Set Up Apple Pay"},{"content":"Assorted facts:\nI post to Facebook and my wife\u0026rsquo;s phone beeps less than a second later.

But if I made them good and true enough they would mean many things.\u0026rdquo;\nHenry Roth [1]\n\u0026ldquo;Any—certainly modern—writer recognizes when his own work, narrative or dramatic, becomes evocative of a symbol; serious writing does have that effect on the writer, even though his attention may be centered elsewhere: in the narrative, in the situation, the character, the language. Speaking for myself, the symbol when it does make itself manifest is, or was, secondary to my main attempt: the construction of a unified, autonomous piece of writing.\u0026rdquo;\nHenry Roth [2]\n\u0026ldquo;The Greeks, Elizabethans, Cervantes, they seemed more interested in creating a type of what existed rather than symbols of abstract ideas, forces, beliefs.\u0026rdquo;\nIris Murdoch\n\u0026ldquo;There is much more symbolism in ordinary life than some critics seem to realize.\u0026rdquo;\nIsaac Asimov\n\u0026ldquo;Consciously? Heavens, no! Unconsciously? How can one avoid it?\u0026rdquo;\nJack Kerouac\n\u0026ldquo;Symbolism is alright in \u0026lsquo;fiction\u0026rsquo; but I tell true life stories simply about what happened to people I know.\u0026rdquo;\nJohn Updike\n\u0026ldquo;I have no method. There is no method in writing fiction. You don\u0026rsquo;t seem to understand.\u0026rdquo;\nJoseph Heller\n\u0026ldquo;I do not subconsciously place symbolism in my writing, although there are inevitably many occasions when events acquire a meaning additional to the one originally intended.\u0026rdquo;\nMary McCarthy [1]\n\u0026ldquo;If the story does not contradict the outline, overrun the pattern, break the symbols, like an insurrection against authority, it is surely a still birth. The natural symbolism of reality has more messages to communicate than the dry Morse code of the disengaged mind.\u0026rdquo;\nMary McCarthy [2]\n\u0026ldquo;At the very moment when American writing was penetrated by the symbolic urge, it ceased to be able to create symbols of its own…The discovery of new symbols is not the only function of a writer.

Language itself is a symbolic form of communication. The great writers all used symbols as a means of controlling the form of their fiction.

Stuff I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about a lot.\nAssumption #1: We elect presidents and making that selection should be democratic.\n(It isn\u0026rsquo;t terribly democratic right now given our electoral system and I\u0026rsquo;m still on the fence about pros/cons of that but that\u0026rsquo;s a different list.)\nAssumption #2: We don\u0026rsquo;t elect candidates. Anybody can run for president if they meet the constitutional requirements. There\u0026rsquo;s no obvious constitutional right to democratically select who runs.\nAssumption #3: The Republican primary system is overall a little more \u0026ldquo;democratic\u0026rdquo; than the Democrats'.\nFewer caucuses, no super delegates, more winner take all which favors popular favorites over underdogs.\nAssumption #4: The republican primaries have promoted poor candidates for several cycles and this year actually selected an unqualified bad candidate.\nThe party ticket is topped by a non-republican who\u0026rsquo;s positions don\u0026rsquo;t align well with the party, who the party doesn\u0026rsquo;t want, and who is an embarrassment to the party.\nContentious Assumption #5: Bernie Sanders was a strong second in the Democratic primary as an outsider who arguably would be bad for the party.\nI like a lot about Bernie but he definitely isn\u0026rsquo;t an insider the party can trust to fall in line to further its interests nation-wide over the long run and up and down the ticket.\nContentious Assumption #6: The major parties serve an important role organizing voters, defining packaged platforms, running grassroots campaigns, fostering candidates at every level, and bringing organization and funding infrastructure to the whole process.\nContentious Assumption #7: Our non-parliamentary executive branch is designed in such a way that a multi-party system would be dangerous. The two party system is the only thing potentially stopping a Trump presidency. And a president elected with 10% of the popular vote has the same exact constitutional power as one elected with 90% of the vote\nI used to be a big \u0026ldquo;third parties!\u0026rdquo; person but on reflection, I think it\u0026rsquo;s a terrible idea. And ultimately I think any party would anger any person in some ways any time it has broad appeal. Only highly factional divisive parties can appeal to all their supporters in every way.\n[Correction: Of course a heavily divided multiparty election would be unlikely to award a majority of electoral votes to any candidate in which case the House of Representatives would choose the winner. You can\u0026rsquo;t win the presidency with 10% of the popular vote. I had forgotten this when I wrote the above.]\nBut the point still stands: not a system well suited to multiple parties.\nBackground: Historically the parties chose their own candidates as they saw fit. This resulted in instances of insider corruption. The current democratization of the primary process is a result of the McGovern-Fraser Commission of 1972.\nLink\nConcession #1: It isn\u0026rsquo;t really a fair characterization to say the parties are \u0026ldquo;private organizations\u0026rdquo; and leave it at that. Given our strong two party system, it is reasonable to at least consider a regulatory infrastructure that encourages transparency in the nominating process.\nContentious Concession #2: The undemocratic structure of the Democratic primary system actually helped Sanders more than it hurt him. Delegate splitting and caucuses both worked to his advantage.\nIf it had been more \u0026ldquo;democratic\u0026rdquo; he would have been out much earlier. Undemocratic caucuses heavily favored Sanders and delegate splitting in general favors the second place candidate because of rounding.\nQuestion #1: What is the justification for open primaries?\nFull disclosure: I\u0026rsquo;m not a member of any political party. Recently (last 4-6 years maybe) I\u0026rsquo;ve begun to consider joining a party and being involved in it locally. I\u0026rsquo;m now pretty sure I will. But as an outsider, I have always refrained from voting in the primaries on philosophical grounds. I\u0026rsquo;m not a participating party member so why should I have a say in who the party runs? I get my say in the election.\nQuestion #2: Does a more democratic primary process undermine the ability for the parties to run effective high quality candidates?\nQuestion #3: Historiclly, what kinds of corruption lead to the McGovern-Fraser Commission and did the reformed system fix those problems?\nQuestion #4: Does the reformed system directly lead to or contribute to promoting lower quality candidates?\nAt all levels, not just just for president. I personally believe Clinton is extremely qualified.\nQuestion #5: How much role should the national party, with an eye toward the efficacy of the whole organization, have in promoting its candidates of choice?\nThis is not meant to be a contentious list. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure of the answers to any of these.\nI wonder out loud if we might have gone too far. I wonder if the party establishment shouldn\u0026rsquo;t openly have a bigger role in promoting its candidates. I wonder if open primaries should be closed so parties can run their own nominating elections. I wonder if last minute party switching to make a primary deadline should be stopped.\nBut mostly I wonder how Trump ended up at the top of one of the two \u0026ldquo;major\u0026rdquo; parties instead of off in a corner saying stupid stuff to an extremist crowd like Jill Stein.\n(Ok that part was meant to be a little contentious. 😶)\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/listapp/on-primaries/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"On Primaries"},{"content":"Good news: I don\u0026rsquo;t have tuberculosis.\nRelated: I didn\u0026rsquo;t think I had tuberculosis.

Full time in the summer, part time during school. The owner was like something out of a made-for-tv remake of a Dickens novel: A beady-eyed hunched-over monster who sat in his upstairs office peering out his window at everyone in the store and counting money. I hated him. People were nice though. This is where I learned the difference between straw and hay during an embarrassing exchange.\n1990-1993: Marsh Grocery — Sacker\nThis was a big step up, from $4/hr to $5.25. I felt rich. I loved this job. The work was fun, the coworkers were diverse (in age) and kind, and the managers were nice. This was small-town Indiana where if they ran out of the sale item they\u0026rsquo;d give you the name-brand version for the same price. Once I accidentally left one sack behind when packing a cart and my manager called the customer and sent me to her house to deliver the bag and an apology. My girlfriend-now-wife worked here too.\n1993: Taco Bell — Cashier and Floor Mopper\nI wanted some extra cash before I moved. A friend was assistant manager at the new Taco Bell and they agreed to let me do odd jobs for a couple of weeks before heading out of state. They never paid me. It devolved to me calling the owner repeatedly at 2:00 am and ask him to please send my check, while he swore at me and said there was nothing I could do about it because it was undocumented so he wasn\u0026rsquo;t paying me.\n1993-1995: CompUSA — Macintosh Sales\nGot this job a week or so after moving to Phoenix. I was a terrible salesman but I knew a ton about macintosh computers so I had a very loyal customer base. We had a lot of fun playing around between customers at this job. But ultimately sales was not my bag.\n1995-1997: MicroAge — Apple Computer Technical Support\nMicroAge had a contract to provide some of Apple\u0026rsquo;s call-in support. \u0026ldquo;Thank you for calling the Apple Assistance Center! My name is Geoff. May I get your first name please?\u0026rdquo; I said that 80 times a day. I actually loved this job and was very good at it because I knew everything about macs and I have a patient disposition. I also learned to build database systems in FileMaker Pro here. Alas the company was awful and I became something of a corporate robin hood before I quit.\n1995-1998: WorqSmart — Database Engineer\nI took what I learned about FileMaker Pro at MicroAge and parlayed it into a job at a small consulting firm in Phoenix. I was genuinely surprised that people would pay money for something as easy as using FileMaker. I met a life-long friend here and started my real career as a software engineer. We did really early pioneering work in dynamic web applications here, which established the direction of my whole career. But, the partners began to fight and then the good partner left so I left too.\n1998: New Perspectives Software — Software Engineer\nWe moved to flagstaff so I could do software engineering for this startup selling small-office management software. Flagstaff was beautiful and the work was fun, but their primary funder ran into financial problems and canceled his disbursements abruptly. They shut the doors a year after I started. We lost our health insurance when my wife was two months pregnant. This was before Obamacare so we were uninsurable. Luckily we had no major medical issues during that time.\n1998-1999: Independent Contractor\nI did freelance database work while we finished school. This often involved driving to phoenix on Thursday afternoon after classes, working 15 hour days Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, and driving back late Sunday night for class Monday morning. While my wife managed a new baby at home all alone all weekend. Ah to be young again.\n1999-2001: Micron Technology — Software Engineer\nFor my first out-of-college job I worked as a systems programmer in Micron\u0026rsquo;s IT department in Idaho. Loved the job. Loved the work. Loved the people. Hated the town. It was so remote and we just missed the culture, friends, and life of a bigger city. I learned Perl at Micron which was fun, and built my first and last Microsoft ASP based web application.\n2001-2004: Waves in Motion — Software Engineer\nBack to the FileMaker world where I built plugins for FileMaker, supported other product development efforts, did some contract database work, and wrote documentation. True story: When I gave notice, I explained that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t manage all my workload and still be there for my wife. With a straight my boss said \u0026ldquo;Have you considered that maybe your wife is holding you back? Maybe you should be giving her notice.\u0026rdquo; The HR director said she was shocked I didn\u0026rsquo;t punch him. I just said \u0026ldquo;no.\u0026rdquo;\n2004: Intentionally Unemployed\nI went back to school for my masters degree. Then six months into that I got a book deal from O\u0026rsquo;Reilly. We had two small children. So I decided to stop working for a few months to focus on the book and school at night and be present to my family during the day. I loved loved loved my long late nights writing.\n2004-2007: Allegro Enterprises — Director of IT\nI started doing contract work after the book was finished, but this client convinced me to work for them full time managing their internal database efforts and managing the rebuild of their web store. I hired four awesome engineers here. One of them went on to be my business partner for seven years (see below), another is my boss now. All of them are still close friend. We also did awesome engineering work here if I may say so.\n2007-2015: Six Fried Rice, LLC — Principal and Engineering Manager\nMy coworker Jesse and I left Allegro and started this software consulting firm. It was fun, uplifting, and engaging the whole time. He was a perfect partner. Our clients were for the most part an absolute blessing, and work was relatively steady. This was a great time. But\u0026hellip;it eventually stopped feeling like a challenge.\n2015-Present: Apple, Inc — Software Engineer\nTwo of my employees at Allegro left after me and took jobs at Apple. They spent the next 7 years trying to convince me to leave Six Fried Rice and join them, but I loved my job too much. Once it started to feel less fulfilling I opened the dialogue with Apple about my needs and they were very accommodating so I made the switch. That last year and a half has been exactly what I wanted: new challenges, learning new things, doing work I\u0026rsquo;m proud of, and flexible enough to be present for my family.\n\u0026ldquo;Some of it\u0026rsquo;s magic, some of it\u0026rsquo;s tragic, but I\u0026rsquo;ve had a good life all the way.\u0026rdquo;\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/listapp/my-work-history/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"My Work History"},{"content":"Today I learned that Bastille Day is not called Bastille Day in France.

She kept it that way for months, and did it again a few years later.\nI love how she never wants some of her own but always wants some of mine.\nI love how she always feels like she can\u0026rsquo;t possibly do what she\u0026rsquo;s about to do and cries and says she\u0026rsquo;s failing and then when she\u0026rsquo;s done it\u0026rsquo;s always perfect.\nI love how much she loves her friends.\nI love that all their kids call her Aunt Mamie.\nI love how every baby in the room is always drawn to her.\nI love how she supported me through a long and complicated career focused way more on making sure I always loved my work than on maximizing income or stability.\nI love how while I was in graduate school and working and we were run ragged, and then I got an offer for a book deal, and I told her I wanted to do it, she immediately gave me support instead of throwing me out on the street.\nI love how she is such a perfectionist that nothing is ever good enough. Even though it drives me a little crazy sometimes.\nI love the funny little face she is probably making right now after reading that last one, with her brow furrowed, her mouth in an exaggerated frown, and her eyes looking off to the side.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; she says.\nI love how she has had a crush on Robert Downy Jr. for years. When we went to see The Avengers she said \u0026ldquo;This\u0026rsquo;ll be great! There\u0026rsquo;s one for you and one for me.\u0026rdquo;\nI love how she knows when I\u0026rsquo;m distracted and doesn\u0026rsquo;t hold it against me.\nI love how 26 years later after 22 years of marriage, 18 years of raising children, 15 years of home ownership, three years of two working parents trying to make it all work, through scares and sorrows, financial struggles, long nights, family reunions, house disasters, and everything else life throws at you, she\u0026rsquo;s still the coolest person I know.\n🙏🏻\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/listapp/99-things-i-love-about-my-wife/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"99 Things I Love About My Wife"},{"content":"You know how sometimes something happens like a woman whose ancestry includes people from India wins Miss America and a handful of uber-dummies on Twitter get up in arms because Miss America is \u0026ldquo;supposed to be an American\u0026rdquo;?

And it is wrong.\nIn fact a fundamental part of \u0026ldquo;relativity\u0026rdquo; is that movement is relative.\nIf you are in a spaceship moving away from earth at near the speed of light then\u0026hellip;\nBy relativity\u0026hellip;\nIt is exactly as correct to say the earth is moving away from your stationary spaceship at near the speed of light.\nWhat is moving and what it \u0026ldquo;still\u0026rdquo; is entirely determined by your reference frame, which is always chosen arbitrarily.\nThere is no \u0026ldquo;true\u0026rdquo; or fundamental reference frame.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t just mathematical mumbo jumbo. The earth really is moving. Relative to the sun it moves in a big circle. Relative to the center of the galaxy it moves on a much bigger circle. And of course the whole galaxy is moving quickly.\nThe fact that you say the space ship is moving away from earth at some speed is just a convenient way to think about it.\nIt isn\u0026rsquo;t the real movement. Or perhaps it is better to say it is the real movement but every other way to think about it is just as real, including the one where the earth is moving at near the speed of light and the ship is still. Or one where they both move away from some other star at different speeds.\nThis concept is absolutely fundamental to Einstein\u0026rsquo;s theory.\nAnd by \u0026ldquo;theory\u0026rdquo; we mean fact. It has been proven repeatedly.\nSo that gets us back to the twin paradox.\nIf moving very very fast makes time slow down\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;but how fast you\u0026rsquo;re moving or if you\u0026rsquo;re moving at all is relative, then which twin experiences slowed time?\nIf the ship is moving at near the speed of light then the Astronaut twin ages more slowly.\nBut if the earth is the thing moving at near the speed of light then it is the earth-bound twin (and every other human) who is aging slowly.\nBecause movement is relative to the reference frame and you can choose any reference frame you want.\nAnd therefore\u0026hellip;\nBOTH ARE TRUE.\nGreat! Then both age slowly and the twins stay the same age, right?\nHeh.\nNo.\nThey don\u0026rsquo;t call it a paradox for nothing.\nFrom the perspective of the twin on the ship, she is aging at a normal rate and her brother on earth is aging slowly. At any given moment she is older than her brother.\nBut from the perspective of the man on earth, it is his ship-bound sister who is aging slowly. From earth\u0026rsquo;s perspective the twin in space is always younger.\nSo we have a scenario where both twins are both older and younger than the other simultaneously.\n⁉️\nIn a relativistic world simultaneity is an illusion. In any two different reference frames the idea of things happening at the same time no longer makes sense.\nIf they could somehow chat via some magic radio what would they find? How could they possibly be both older and younger than the other and somehow converse about it?\nThey can\u0026rsquo;t. This is why we\u0026rsquo;re reasonably sure it is impossible to communicate (which is to say transfer any information at all) at faster than the speed of light.\nIf you can, then given the same principles as the twin paradox, you can easily set up a scenario where you cause something to happen backwards. In other words, where the effect happens before the cause.\nAnd we choose to believe in a universe that obeys \u0026ldquo;causality\u0026rdquo; over one that obeys simultaneity, or allows faster-than-light communication. It just seems more likely to be true.\nI have been thinking about the twin paradox tonight. The strange idea of time passing differently for one person vs another.\nIt seems like yesterday that I took my kids to Biosphere 2 in Tucson.\nLike literally it feels like it happened so recently it may have been this year.\nBut I just saw the pictures and Isabel looked so young.\nIt was when she was in middle school.\nFor me, a heartbeat.\nFor her, the entire high school experience.\nNow neither of us was moving at relativistic speeds relative to the other. But still\u0026hellip;\nTwo people\u0026hellip;\nConnected by life and love\u0026hellip;\nMoving through life at different rates.\nMy frame of reference is no less valid than hers.\nAnd perhaps we can never really bridge the gap in understanding of these years.\nBut I choose to believe that she and I were there\u0026hellip;\nAnd now we are here\u0026hellip;\nAnd whatever happened\u0026hellip;\nHowever strange the phenomenon that divides our perception\u0026hellip;\nCausality was preserved.\nAnd despite what it seems, the fabric of our universe is sound.\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/listapp/the-twin-paradox/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"The Twin Paradox"},{"content":"Maybe this is just a thing schools do now because @sophster goes to a totally different school from @imc and her \u0026ldquo;8th Grade Promotion\u0026rdquo; included a personal message/tribute to each kid too!

She has had a long run of truly great teachers. I\u0026rsquo;m sure I\u0026rsquo;m leaving off a few that belong here.\nKindergarten: Miss Mason.\nSometimes I think a good chunk of her academic success comes down to her awesome introduction to school. Miss Mason was enthusiastic, fun, firm, hilarious, utterly in control of 25 five year olds, and just infectiously wonderfully kind. We truly loved her.\nFirst Grade: Mrs. Gust and Miss Trasinsky\nIsabel loved this classroom and especially all the books that were made available to her. These team-teachers divided responsibilities and they were so professional and competent at parent conferences it made me feel like she was in a great place.\nSecond Grade: Miss Finnegan\nWe moved to a new neighborhood and a new school and Isabel made the transition beautifully in no small part due to Miss Finnegan\u0026rsquo;s warm loving style.\nThird Grade: Mr. Block (Music)\nIsabel loved soft spoken Mr. Block with his warm smile and his classroom full to the brim with assorted musical instruments. He was the first to recommend Isabel find and join and extracurricular choir. She has been in choirs of one kind or another ever since and she truly loves it.\nThird Grade: Mrs. LaBrie\nMrs. LaBrie came to Isabel\u0026rsquo;s extracurricular choir concert to show her support. I remember being so surprised that she would make that effort. She also inspired Isabel to pay more attention to math. Unfortunately other circumstances got messy at this school and we decided to move her to a new school for fourth grade.\nFourth Grade: Mrs. Jaswant\nI will always and forever hold Jaswant in the highest esteem for her compassion and commitment to educating children, her refreshing directness in dealing with parents, and her deep deep competence. She was demanding and Isabel loved it. Isabel also took to her new school, a Montessori school, like a fish to water. This school was a great gift to my family.\nFifth and Sixth Grade: Miss Lindsey\nThis was Miss Lindsey\u0026rsquo;s first year teaching after completing her education at Berkeley and her Montessori training. Obviously we were a little concerned about a dip in quality but it was misplaced. Lindsey became something of a hero to Isabel. She was brilliant, well equipped to teach, academically gifted, softspoken, and she had hair that went from green to blue to pink (and sometimes mixed) throughout the year. Isabel still talks to her periodically. Miss Lindsey is a family treasure.\nFifth and Sixth Grade: Miss M\nThis school always had assistant teachers in every classroom. Miss M was the 4/5/6 assistant all the way through Isabel and Sophia\u0026rsquo;s years. She and Isabel bonded over their love of reading. Later Sophia would bond with her over acting and improv.\nMiddle School: Mr. Pagani (Latin)\nIsabel started a new school in 7th grade, and stayed there through high school. She and Mr. Pagani had a rough patch in the middle but things started off great in seventh grade Latin 1 and ended great in senior year Greek 2. Mr. Pagani is an uber-nerd who recites Latin and Greek like a Shakespearean actor and truly deeply loves his subject.\nMiddle School: Mrs. Joyner (Latin 2)\nIsabel loved Mrs. Joyner. Everybody loves Mrs. Joyner. She was loud, excited, determined, intense, and just exuded smartness. She was also stylish. Isabel found out she loved creme brûlée so she asked me to help her make one for Mrs. Joyner. She also painted her a little dish to make it in that said \u0026ldquo;Et tu brûlée\u0026rdquo; in the bottom. (What can I say, may baby\u0026rsquo;s a nerd). Mrs. Joyner LOVED it and laughed and laughed about it. She was just one of those people you immediately like and pay attention to.\nMiddle School: Miss Koci (Music)\nI maybe had a little crush on Miss Koci. She was just so smart and so funny and so warm. And a little sarcastic. Isabel loved her too as she introduced her to a more formal approach to singing including music theory and study of music in many forms.\nMiddle School: Mrs. Stork (Literature)\nMiss Stork was studious, demanding, kind, and full of love for literature. In other words, Isabel adored her.\nHigh School: Mr. Patak (Geometry)\nSmall soft spoken Mr. Patak taught Geometry as though it were the most beautiful of the liberal arts. (I happen to agree that classical geometry is staggeringly beautiful so I liked him right away.) At a time when Isabel was starting to resent math classes, he really opened her eyes, encouraged her, and gave her a super-positive year of learning. He was a gem.\nHigh School: Mr. Hjelmberg (Humane Letters)\nIsabel still has a crush on this nerdy, brilliant, handsome man. I still remember the lesson he taught the parents at \u0026ldquo;curriculum night\u0026rdquo; as really fascinating, fun, and insightful. He left the school her sophomore year but they\u0026rsquo;re still in touch.\nHigh School: Mr. Sullivan (Latin)\nMr. Sullivan is the grandfather of the school and after five seconds in his classroom it is obvious he is a super-competent and likable teacher. He is one of those crazy people who quits a lucrative career (corporate law in his case) late in life to become a teacher. My favorite thing about Mr. Sullivan is how much he encouraged Isabel to stop worrying about grades, stop stressing about school, and enjoy learning and life every day.\nHigh School: Mr. Coaloa (Humane Letters)\nIsabel always loved her Humane Letters teachers. She gets to spend a two hour double period every day discussing literature and history with a class full of smart kids and a smart teacher. It is so much her thing. Mr. Coaloa and his wife Miss Tucker (see below) moved to flagstaff and Isabel has visited with them twice.\nHigh School: Miss Tucker (Drama)\nMiss Tucker took an interest in Isabel a year or two before she actually had her in class. She encouraged Isabel\u0026rsquo;s poetry, helped her form poetry club, and just all around gave her tons of love and support. She also directed Isabel as Conrad in Much Ado About Nothing. I think they\u0026rsquo;ll be life long friends.\nHigh School: Mrs. Rathsburg (Music)\nI listed about Mrs. Rathsburg\u0026rsquo;s beautiful tribute to Isabel last week. Link She is a tiny powerhouse of energy, brilliance, and kindness. Isabel admires her so much.\nHigh School: Mr. Dickerson (Humane Letters)\nTweedy sardonic unpretentious Mr. Dickerson finishes out Isabel\u0026rsquo;s four years of Humane Letters coaching her through (among many others) the difficult Brothers Karamazov. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if she knows it but he loves Isabel and always makes a point to tell us.\nHigh School: Mr. Ward (Physics)\nMr. Ward is a fan favorite at Isabel\u0026rsquo;s school. He\u0026rsquo;s tiny and dorky and he knows it so he plays it up with theatrical flair, wearing sweater vests and drinking chocolate milk through a straw. Mr. Ward perfectly walks the line between irreverent funny approachability and the highest academic standards. He demands a lot from his students and he gets it because they all love him.\nHigh School: Mr. Sifert (Thesis Advisor)\nSmart, sarcastic, demanding, and complimentary. Mr. Sifert was a great advisor for Isabel\u0026rsquo;s Senior Thesis. He pushed and pushed and gave her tons of advice and direction. And he was funny and encouraging all the way through.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/listapp/thank-you-teachers/","tags":["Archive Post","Photos"],"title":"Thank You Teachers"},{"content":"All the gifs I remember thinking were very funny.\nBasically my whole motivation to work in computers is to help advance us to the point that it is feasible to remake the whole movie like this.

It says \u0026ldquo;to answer that question here\u0026rsquo;s everything we need to know.\u0026rdquo;\nThen we can judge how much we do and don\u0026rsquo;t know, and work towards a better and better answer.\nThe equation is essentially just a bunch of terms multiplied together:\nR★ — The rate of star formation in the universe.\nHow fast does the universe make new stars? We have a pretty good sense of this. Our galaxy produces about seven per year on average, and we have a good estimate of the number and size of galaxies in the visible universe.\nf(p) — Fraction of stars orbited by planets.\nThis is one of the most exciting factors because when I was young we really had no idea. But thanks to awesome ongoing science including the amazing Kepler mission we now know this factor may be close to 1: it is starting to seem like pretty much all stars have planets.\nn(e) — Average number of earth-like bodies found in a planet-bearing star system.\nAgain, until very recently we had no idea. But Kepler data has taught us a ton about the prevalence of planets similar to ours in size and proximity to their host stars. Considering just size and position, A good estimate right now is about 0.4. We don\u0026rsquo;t know much about the atmospheres of exoplanets yet but missions now in development will help close that gap.\nf(l) — Fraction of planets suitable for life that actually go on to develop life.\nWe only have ourselves to look at here so we don\u0026rsquo;t know anything with certainty. On earth, life popped up very soon after the planet became suitable to it, and life has adapted to very diverse conditions. But as far as we know it only started once. And earth may be weird. We continue to search for evidence of past life on Mars, and we\u0026rsquo;re doing exciting pre-planning for searches on other bodies. If we can find and study even extinct microbial life it will allow us to begin making estimates here.\nf(i) — Fraction of life that develops intelligence.\nAgain, we only have ourselves to go on, which isn\u0026rsquo;t much. There\u0026rsquo;s no good consensus for this value and we\u0026rsquo;re nowhere near solving that. But we can keep trying!\nf(c) — Fraction of intelligent life that produces detectable signals.\nEarth has had intelligent life for 200,000 years and we\u0026rsquo;ve only been sending signals into space for less than a hundred years. Is that normal? Fast? Slow? We don\u0026rsquo;t know.\nL — Average lifetime of an intelligent civilization.\nHow long will we continue to thrive, grow, learn, and push further into the universe? The universe is very very old and we are very very young. It is possible intelligent life is \u0026ldquo;common\u0026rdquo; but so short-lived that two civilizations never coexist.\nIf we knew the precise value for every term we could plug them in and get a valid probabilistic estimate of the number of intelligent civilizations out there that we could hope to detect.\nThe coolest thing about the Drake equation is how beautifully it illustrates why our growing knowledge of esoteric subjects is interesting.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a penchant for anti-intellectualism these days so you often hear people dismiss scientific inquiry on the grounds that what is being studied is small and unimportant.\nThe Drake equation reminds us that big questions — who we are, how we came to be, where we\u0026rsquo;re going — are really just incredibly complex intricate collections of small questions that might otherwise seem pointless.\nAnd it reminds us that our ever-increasing knowledge is a beautiful and uniquely human thing.\nAnd finally it gives us hope that by continuing to ask and answer and improve our understanding we may be stretching our own L.\nAnd I think our L is worth stretching.\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/listapp/r-f-p-n-e-f-l-f-i-f-c-l/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"R★ × f(p) × n(e) × f(l) × f(i) × f(c) × L"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m going to miss making Isabel her special finals week \u0026ldquo;power breakfast\u0026rdquo;.

I\u0026rsquo;ve never been comfortable at a party in my life. But! It is important to people I love (both people I go with and hosts) and so it is a small sacrifice to make an appearance when appropriate.

You kids today don\u0026rsquo;t know what it was like back then listening over and over with headphones and a pen and paper trying to work out the words so you can process them. R.E.M. was the first to put me through that.\nFind the River - Link (This is arguably their most beautiful and esoteric song and the whole thing could go on this list, but here\u0026rsquo;s the end.)\nThe river to the ocean goes / a fortune for the undertow. / None of this is going my way. / There is nothing left to throw / of ginger, lemon, indigo, / coriander stem and rows of hay. / Strength and courage override / the privìleged and weary eyes / of river poet search naïveté. / Pick up here and chase the ride / the river empties to the tide. / All of this is coming your way.\nBlue - (Their best last line for sure, gave the album it\u0026rsquo;s title.

Some day I\u0026rsquo;ll list about that process which was somewhat harrowing.\nI actually wrote five editions of the book. But all but the first were various degrees of revision.\nHere are all the great things about this work of high brow literature.\nIt is chock full of Buffy the Vampire Slayer references.\nAnd some Harry Potter references.\nThese were a little more obscure when I wrote it in 2003.\nAnd one secret Les Miserables reference.\nAnd a few others.\nIt has pictures of my kids in some of the figures. For example on page 246 of the FileMaker 8 edition.\nIt is 800 pages all written in Microsoft Word for Mac. It crashed a lot while I was writing it. I developed a deep-seated hatred for Word during those years.\nMy original editor was David Pogue, formerly the tech editor for the New York Times, now with Yahoo. He was absolutely amazing to work with. No exaggeration. Smart, fast, responsive, supportive, and super insightful about writing clearly about technology.\nIt is full of pretty dumb jokes because I like dumb jokes.\nI just threw away three boxes full of old copies when I cleaned my garage. I kept one of each edition.\nIt was translated to French and Japanese.\nThere was talk of a German translation but it never came together.\nIt is 800 pages and I had to read it cover to cover twice after writing it. And of course I read each and every sentence many times while writing. That last full read through was one of the most boring reads of my life.\nIt has my email address in it. For years I got emails from readers, but they eventually dwindled. I always tried to answer their questions comprehensively, which was usually fun.\nBut once a guy emailed me. I replied that I was busy but I\u0026rsquo;d give it some attention over the weekend. He replied that he needed an answer sooner than that. I ignored this. He emailed two more times that day demanding a faster reply. That was the only reader question I never answered. Jerk.\nI made all the illustrations by hand in Adobe Illustrator which I had never used before.\nIt has no dedication. The publisher never asked me for one and I was too shy to ask about it.\nThe first chapter is close to but not exactly the same as the writing sample I sent O\u0026rsquo;Reilly when I pitched the book.\nWhen it was first released I went to Borders (remember them?) to look at it on the shelf. I bought a copy. Even though I had a box full they sent me for free. What a dork.\nI have seen it in the wild a few times.

The empty trolley (no passengers and unmanned) is coming and will certainly kill them all. If you throw the switch the trolley will divert down a side track and kill one person who happens to be standing on the track. What do you do?\nYou are on a bridge over the tracks standing next to an unknown very fat man and the same trolley will pass under you before killing the five people. If you push the fat man off the bridge his body will stop the trolley before it kills the five. What do you do?\nYou are on the bridge in the same scenario as above with one caveat: you know that the fat man is the person who tied up the five in an attempt to kill them. What do you do?\nYou\u0026rsquo;re the switch operator again but this time the switch only puts the train on a loop such that it will loop around and continue on the main track to kill the five tied up people. But on the loop is an innocent fat man who will stop the train if you throw the switch. What do you do?\nYou are a doctor and you have five patients each desperately in need of a different organ transplant or they will soon die. You have no organs available and so it is hopeless. A healthy man comes in for a checkup and you discover he is a match for every one of your five patients. If you kill him you can save five. What do you do?\nA slight variation on the first: you are not a switch operator. Rather you are remotely controlling another trolley. You can ram the trolley from behind forcing it off the tracks before it kills the five. If you do it will derail, roll down a hill, and kill a man sleeping in the park. What do you do?\n\u0026hellip;\nMost people feel you are morally justified in flipping the switch in #1. Some even feel you are morally obligated. People are much less likely to support throwing the fat man off the bridge (#2). If the fat man is evil (#3) people almost universally support throwing him off the bridge.\nFor some reason putting the fat man on a loop of track (#4) makes killing him more palatable to some people. Perhaps because by virtue of his being on a track, fate has somehow \u0026ldquo;involved\u0026rdquo; him in the scenario.\nAlmost nobody supports killing a man to harvest his organs (#5). In the absence of trolley problem context this seems obvious. But in context most people have trouble articulating a justification for the position. (Eg, from a strictly \u0026ldquo;utilitarian\u0026rdquo; point of view the doctor may be justified. But nobody feels that way anyway.)\n#6 seems conceptually identical to #1 which is considered justifiable. Interestingly if you ask people #6 in isolation they generally say it is unjustified. This again may be because the man in the park is \u0026ldquo;uninvolved\u0026rdquo;. But if you ask them after asking #1 they say it is justified, probably in an attempt to remain consistent.\n\u0026hellip;\nHow did you answer each of these, and more importantly, why?\nDo you think being \u0026ldquo;involved\u0026rdquo; makes someone a more justifiable collateral casualty?\nDid you say yes to number one and no to #5? Can you explain why? If you rewrite the problem to remove the reasons your answer differed does your answer still differ? For instance maybe you think the doctor\u0026rsquo;s actions are illegal so that\u0026rsquo;s makes it wrong.

But still the first of the \u0026ldquo;only Pixar makes animated movies like this\u0026rdquo; collection. Full of heart.\nFinding Nemo\nThis is an empathically stressful movie. Poor five year old @imc was destroyed by the death of the mom and babies and that was in the first ten minutes. We had to recuperate in the theater lobby for a few minutes.

The whole fish in the net scene is completely unnecessary.\nThe Good Dinosaur\nFocused on a younger audience so it lacked the complexity I love in Pixar but still very beautiful and very touching.\nToy Story 2\nTo say this is the least good Toy Story is hardly faint praise. A worthy addition to the best animated trilogy ever.\nMonster\u0026rsquo;s, Inc.\nI loved the sweetness of this movie and @imc was just the right age so I remember seeing it in the theater very fondly.\nToy Story\nThis is both a wonderful movie and a piece of film history.\nRatatouille\nThis movie moves up in my ranking both because it is a beautiful unapologetic work of love and also for the perfect \u0026ldquo;review\u0026rdquo; that ends the movie. \u0026ldquo;Only now do I truly understand what he meant. Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere.\u0026rdquo; 💯\nBrave\nMoving, beautiful, genre busting, and important. @sophster said it well in her list.

Which is saying something when you\u0026rsquo;re being asked to identify with a cowboy doll. Impeccable.\nWALL-E\nThis movie quietly, meticulously celebrates companionship and what it means to truly be human.

The latter can itself have two interpretations: All is always well from the right perspective, or more commonly that suffering is \u0026ldquo;for our own good\u0026rdquo;.\nEpicurean\nThe modern meaning of Epicurean is almost completely disconnected from the Ancient Greek philosophy of Epicureanism. This philosophy rejects divinity of any kind and does promote \u0026ldquo;pleasure seeking\u0026rdquo; but explicitly teaches that the path to true pleasure is modest living, simple means, and the gaining of knowledge through study. The ultimate pleasure is to understand the world so well you no longer depend on fulfilling superficial desires like fine foods, drink, and materialism to be happy.\nStoic\nThis one is actually pretty close. Stoicism is a philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium (not that Zeno) that espouses self control over emotional response and an acceptance of life in harmony with \u0026ldquo;nature\u0026rdquo; which is to say, your life is what it is so learn to be happy despite hardship rather than allow hardship to rob you of happiness. Epictetus famously once said we should be \u0026ldquo;sick and yet happy, in peril and yet happy, dying and yet happy, in exile and yet happy, in disgrace and yet happy.\u0026rdquo;\nCynic\nPhilosophical cynicism rejects all standard measures of success and seeks happiness through \u0026ldquo;virtue\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s practitioners rejected wealth, luxury, material possession, and even general concepts like power and fame, and cultural norms of dress and custom. Anything that isn\u0026rsquo;t valuable in nature itself is devalued. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how this came to be associated with contemporary cynicism except that a cynic would probably question the root motives of cultural compliance that others take for granted.\nSkeptic\nThe Greek philosophy of Scepticism holds that we have no true knowledge and perhaps knowing anything with certainty is impossible. That all knowledge is built ultimately upon some assumed truth (religious or otherwise) and therefore is akin to faith but not true knowledge. Scepticism even discounts the validity of direct observation as unverifiable.\nManichean\nThis is a much less common word but you see it in academic writing, often implying a sort of confused dualism: a person who can\u0026rsquo;t make up his mind or is inconsistent in his thinking. Manichaenism itself was a prevalent post-pagan religion that taught a dualistic view of nature: the world of matter and the world of light. We live between these worlds, a material being imbued with the potential for divinity.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/listapp/words-that-get-their-meaning-from-a-poor-interpretation-of-the-formal-philosophy-theyre-named-after/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Words That Get

In other words they\u0026rsquo;ve made their formal argument for why they believe the order is invalid. Link It is quite readable but here\u0026rsquo;re the basics of Apple\u0026rsquo;s 3-part argument.\n1️⃣ The All Writs Act does not give the government the authority to make this order because:\n- it does not apply if congress has already considered a power and rejected it.\nThe courts have said it \u0026ldquo;does not authorize courts to issue ad hoc writs whenever compliance with statutory procedure appear inconvenient or less appropriate.\u0026rdquo;\n- and in the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) Congress did consider strong encryption and explicitly authorized phone companies to use it…\n- and explicitly said the government cannot dictate what technology they use or don\u0026rsquo;t use\n- and explicitly said the government cannot compel them to break encryption put in place by their users.\nThe law says phone companies are not responsible for \u0026ldquo;decrypting, or ensuring the government\u0026rsquo;s ability to decrypt, any communication encrypted by a subscriber or customer unless the encryption was provided by the carrier and the carrier possesses the information necessary to decrypt the communication.\u0026rdquo;\nApple is not a phone company (like Verizon etc) but they argue that this clearly indicates Congress did consider the implications of encryption and of forced back doors meaning the All Writs Act doesn\u0026rsquo;t apply.\nApple also points out that congress did consider revising CALEA to mandate back doors but \u0026ldquo;abandoned\u0026rdquo; the idea.\n- Also Apple says they are “far removed” from the case\nIn the precedent being used to issue this order the courts said it could not be used if the company is \u0026ldquo;far removed\u0026rdquo; and Apple says they only built and sold the phone. They did not hold the data, transfer the data, assist in its usage etc…so they are not connected to the case in any direct way.\n- and Apple says the burden on them is too great\nAgain in the case being used as precedent is says the action a company is being compelled to take must be \u0026ldquo;meager\u0026rdquo; and must not go strongly against their interests. Apple says the work involved is significant and that doing it will damage their reputation.\n- and Apple says the FBI did not exhaust all other options first.\nAgain, the precedent says compelling the company to act must be the government\u0026rsquo; only option. Apple points out that the FBI may have had another option but due to mishandling of the phone they closed that door on themselves.\nAs an aside, Apple points out that the FBI seems to have mislead the court on the circumstances of that mishandled evidence, claiming the county made the mistake and then later admitting that the county was operating under FBI instruction.\n- finally Apple attempts to discredit the other cases the FBI cites showing how each is a very different situation from this case.\nWrapping up, Apple argues that if the All Writs Act power is expanded in this way, it will establish precedent that can be used to compel other companies and individuals to do all kinds of things\u0026hellip;\n- Apple could be required to write code to turn on the microphone on an iPhone to listen in\n- or use the camera to watch people\n- or use the gps to track people\u0026rsquo;s movements\n- or a pharmaceutical company could be compelled to make drugs for lethal injections against its will\n- or a journalist could be compelled to plant a false story to aid in capturing a fugitive\n- or a software company could be compelled to put malicious code into the automatic update system so it is installed on their users\u0026rsquo; computers secretly\n\u0026ldquo;Under the government\u0026rsquo;s formulation, any party whose assistance is deemed \u0026rsquo;necessary\u0026rsquo;…falls within the ambit of the All Writs Act and can be compelled to do anything the government needs to effectuate a lawful court order. While these sweeping powers may be nice to have from the government\u0026rsquo;s perspective, they simply are not authorized by the law…\u0026rdquo;\n2️⃣ The order violates Apple\u0026rsquo;s first amendment right to freedom of speech.\n- The courts have repeatedly affirmed that writing computer software is a form of expression protected by the first amendment.\n- and the courts have affirmed that forcing someone to speak is just as carefully protected by the constitution as forcing them not to speak.\n- So Apple says that the order “discriminates on the basis of viewpoint”.\n- In other words when Apple chose to create software making it easy and automatic to encrypt all your data they were expressing a viewpoint about privacy and public safety.\n- Forcing Apple to make new software to undermine this compels them to express a viewpoint contrary to their established beliefs.\nApple says the legally allowable restriction on free speech in support of government interests does not go this far.\n3️⃣ The order violates Apple\u0026rsquo;s fifth amendment right to due process of law.\n- the fifth amendment guarantees the right to be free from “arbitrary deprivation of liberty by government”.\n- Apple argues that compelling them to “do the government\u0026rsquo;s bidding in a way that is statutorily unauthorized, highly burdensome, and contrary to [their] core principles” violates this right.\nIn conclusion\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;This is not a case about one isolated iPhone. Rather this case is about the DOJ and the FBI seeking through the courts a dangerous power that Congress and the American people have withheld: the ability to force companies like Apple to undermine the basic security and privacy interests of hundreds of millions of individuals around the globe.\u0026rdquo;\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/listapp/apples-argument-in-the-unlock-this-iphone-case/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Apple's Argument in the \"Unlock-This-iPhone\" Case"},{"content":"In its legal filing today, Apple refers to the bespoke operating system the FBI wants them to build to hack iPhones as \u0026ldquo;GovtOS\u0026rdquo; which cracks me up for some reason.\nGovtOS 1.0 will hopefully never be released\u0026hellip;\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/fb/in-its-legal-filing-today-apple-refers-to-the/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":""},{"content":"This list is so dumb.\n\u0026ldquo;GIF\u0026rdquo; stands for \u0026ldquo;Graphic Interchange Format\u0026rdquo;. It is a de facto standard for images released by CompuServe in 1987.\nRemember CompuServe? Of course you don\u0026rsquo;t. It is a really old online service kind of like America Online but older. But you all don\u0026rsquo;t remember that either. It\u0026rsquo;s like pre-Internet online shopping and social media with a Linux command line.

Consequently it can\u0026rsquo;t show full color images without ugly dithering.\n- it uses an and old and naive approach to compression so it isn\u0026rsquo;t super efficient at saving space.\n- it\u0026rsquo;s mechanism for animation is ridiculously naive. It\u0026rsquo;s just like a flip book. A pile of individual pictures that show one after another. This results in small images with poor quality and low frame rates that require more bandwidth than what you get from high quality animations in a decent format.\nSo why are they so popular?\nIn truth they aren\u0026rsquo;t. Because today when people say GIF they mean something different. They mean an image that:\n- is animated\n- is short\n- has no audio\n- plays inline on the page automatically and easily with no fussy controls\nSometimes it\u0026rsquo;s an actual GIF. But usually not because eventually the gif hosting sites realize they\u0026rsquo;re wasting tons of expensive bandwidth serving up these low quality animations in a ridiculously inefficient way so they use a different format instead.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know the internals of list app, but I\u0026rsquo;d bet money when you put a GIF in your list you\u0026rsquo;re actually getting an \u0026ldquo;H264\u0026rdquo; video with no audio track.\nBut it says GIF on the corner. And on the icon. And the service that gives them to you is called \u0026ldquo;Giphy\u0026rdquo;. And everyone says \u0026ldquo;I love GIFs\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I hate GIFs\u0026rdquo;. And we argue about whether it is pronounced \u0026ldquo;GIF\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;JIF\u0026rdquo;.\nI find it fascinating.\nWords and meaning are way more powerful than RFCs and standards bodies.\nAnd GIFs belong to people now, not to programmers.\nAnd that is kind of cool.\nBut I still hate GIF.\nBecause it\u0026rsquo;s a crappy format.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/listapp/a-brief-history-of-the-gif/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"A Brief History of the GIF"},{"content":" Blindfolded and unconscious.\nIf I were Brian Sandoval I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be on the list in the first place.\nSeaWorld is even more awful than we thought.

So 1: My bias is showing. 2: It should go without saying that I don\u0026rsquo;t speak for Apple in any way. These are my own thoughts.\nAs has been widely reported, Apple is fighting a court order to \u0026ldquo;unlock\u0026rdquo; an iPhone used by one of the shooters in the San Bernardino terrorist attack last year.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the New York Times on the ruling:\nLink\nAnd here\u0026rsquo;s Apple\u0026rsquo;s open letter explaining their position:\nLink\nWhat does the FBI want?\nThe FBI wants to see the data (notes, emails, phone logs, iMessages, apps, etc\u0026hellip;) stored on the phone.\nWhy can\u0026rsquo;t they get it themselves?\nGetting this data off someone\u0026rsquo;s iPhone when they have a passcode enabled is very difficult for three reasons: Full device encryption, passcode throttling, and automatic erase.\nWhat is full device encryption?\nBy default, iPhones use \u0026ldquo;full device encryption\u0026rdquo; meaning any data in the flash storage on the device is locked with a secret key based on your passcode. The data is \u0026ldquo;cryptographically secure\u0026rdquo; meaning it is impractical to \u0026ldquo;unscramble\u0026rdquo; it without knowing the secret key. Even if you open the phone and take out the \u0026ldquo;memory\u0026rdquo; it is impossible to interpret the data contained therein if you don\u0026rsquo;t have the passcode. So the FBI needs to figure out the passcode.\nWhat is passcode throttling?\nThe phone is capable of verifying a passcode very quickly. Theoretically it could check ten thousand passcodes in about fifteen minutes. But when you enter the wrong passcode it makes you wait, a little longer each time, making attempting many different codes impractical.\nWhat is automatic erase?\nIn addition to throttling, if someone guesses the wrong code too many times the phone will assume you are trying to break into it and automatically erase itself.\nWhy does the iPhone do these things?\nIncreasingly your phone is a repository for more and more data, and ever more important data. Phones often have financial information, credit card payment capabilities, private texts to your significant other, health and healthcare information… And phones are small and easy to steal. It is important to protect this information from criminals. It is also important to protect information from governments and agencies around the world who may not be as benevolent as the United States government.\nWhat is the FBI asking Apple to do?\nApple says they have cooperated with the FBI on this case, handing over records, iCloud data, and advice. But they have said that they cannot \u0026ldquo;unlock\u0026rdquo; the phone because it is designed to be unbreakable, even by Apple themselves. But security on this order is very complex and the FBI has devised a way to break into the phone. Their method requires Apple to write special software and install it on the phone to break through the protections on the device.\nWhy can\u0026rsquo;t the FBI write the custom firmware themselves?\nTo prevent exposing your iPhone to this kind of attack by third parties, Apple has designed the phone so that all firmware must be \u0026ldquo;cryptographically\u0026rdquo; signed by Apple before the phone will run it. This just means there\u0026rsquo;s another secret key that only Apple knows and without this key you can\u0026rsquo;t make firmware for an iPhone. This one key is arguably Apple\u0026rsquo;s biggest secret and they have a tremendous interest in keeping it secret.\nWhat would the software do?\nThe FBI wants Apple to write a custom \u0026ldquo;firmware\u0026rdquo; for this phone that disables passcode throttling and automatic erase. Once this is installed on the phone (using a special mode available on every iPhone to install updated software without booting it in case your phone gets \u0026ldquo;bricked\u0026rdquo;), the FBI or Apple would be able to determine the passcode using a \u0026ldquo;brute force\u0026rdquo; attack on the device.\nWhat is a brute force attack?\nThis simply means guessing a password by trying every possibility. If the phone has a 4 digit passcode, you can simply try everything from 0000 to 9999 until you find the right code. This gets harder with longer or more complex passcodes, but without throttling and automatic erase, there\u0026rsquo;s plenty of time to crack the passcode.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t companies have to give data to police all the time?\nYes! What makes this case special is that the government is ordering Apple to create new software. There is no legal precedent for how far the government can go to force them to act in this way. Apple does not have the data and explicitly designed the system so that the data is completely secure. The government is compelling them to find a way around it, using their knowledge of the system, and crack it for them. The FBI is arguing that the \u0026ldquo;All Writs Act\u0026rdquo; gives the government this authority.\nWhat is the All Writs Act?\nIt is a very old 18th century law that serves as a sort of catch-all for cases where the government wants to order someone to do something. It is very broad and new uses of the act usually require judicial interpretation. The important part of the law is simply: \u0026ldquo;The Supreme Court and all courts established by Act of Congress may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Writ\u0026rdquo; just means \u0026ldquo;court order\u0026rdquo;.\nDoes the All Writs Act say the court can order Apple to do this?\nIt is unclear. The FBI says yes. Apple\u0026rsquo;s lawyers say no. A federal judge has now said yes. I\u0026rsquo;m not a lawyer but I would guess the argument hinges on interpretation of the \u0026ldquo;agreeable to the usages and principles of law\u0026rdquo; part. Is compelling Apple to act in this way agreeable to legal principles? The courts will decide.\nIs Apple breaking the law by refusing to comply?\nNo. Apple is not refusing a court order. They are fighting the order using the standard legal process. A lower court has ruled that they must create the firmware. Apple will appeal to the appellate court. If they lose that appeal the Supreme Court may agree to hear the case or let the lower ruling stand. If the Supreme Court orders Apple to comply they will have no choice.\nIs this a \u0026ldquo;back door\u0026rdquo;?\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a semantic debate going on in the media right now about this. Some people are claiming that this will allow anybody to unlock any phone if the software \u0026ldquo;gets out\u0026rdquo; or that the FBI will be able to secretly spy on anyone\u0026rsquo;s phone. This is not true. It is technically possible to create the firmware such that it only works on this one phone and the court order allows Apple to do the work and hand the data to the FBI so the FBI never has possession of the hacked firmware.\nSo is it a \u0026ldquo;back door\u0026rdquo;?\nAlthough it isn\u0026rsquo;t a blanket tool to spy on any phone, it is a legal mechanism by which the FBI (with court order) or any other entity with legal force, can require Apple to bypass device security. There\u0026rsquo;s no obvious way to ensure that only the American government demands use of this technique and no way to know how often the FBI and local police investigators would require Apple to hack a phone in this way. So from that perspective it is a back door.\nWhy doesn\u0026rsquo;t Apple want to do this?\nI don\u0026rsquo;t speak for Apple. All I know about their motivations comes from their public statement at the link above.\nWhy do you think Apple doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to do this?\nWhat part of \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t speak for Apple\u0026rdquo; do you not understand?\nOk ok, why should we care if Apple does this?\nNobody I know thinks we should be protecting murderers from the full investigative power of the US government. The important question of this case is how far the government can go toward compelling an individual or company to provide material support against their own interests. The FBI is asking Apple to exploit a weakness in their own phone. Apple engineers should be focused singularly on fixing that weakness, not exploiting it.\nIf Apple fixes the weakness then there\u0026rsquo;s no more problem right?\nThis gets to the heart of the issue. Suppose Apple fixes this weakness so that new iPhones can no longer be hacked in this way. Using precedent established in this case, it would be reasonable to assume that the FBI could then compel Apple to find and exploit a new weakness in the new phone. Apple is then in the unfortunate position of devoting engineering resources to circumventing the very systems they\u0026rsquo;re trying to create.\nAre there other concerns?\nYes: A precedent that says the government can compel a company to create new software to aid their investigation could be used to compel Apple to weaken other systems. iMessages, for example, are very secure. Apple \u0026ldquo;can\u0026rsquo;t\u0026rdquo; read them in transit. But it is the same kind of \u0026ldquo;can\u0026rsquo;t\u0026rdquo; here. Apple engineers could probably hack the system in some way so that they can be intercepted. We should not want Apple to be in that kind of business.\nDoesn\u0026rsquo;t Apple have a business interest here too?\nYes absolutely. First, almost 70% of apple\u0026rsquo;s customers are not in the United States. Those customers are often legitimately concerned about American government overreach vis a vis the Snowden revelations because they don\u0026rsquo;t have the constitutional protections Americans have. Being cozy with the post-Snowden USA could hurt Apple\u0026rsquo;s business. Also, Apple uses its privacy position as a competitive differentiator in its battle with Android for the phone market. Appearing strong on privacy is good PR.\nDoes Apple really want to be seen supporting terrorists?\nI don\u0026rsquo;t speak for Apple but it is unfortunate that this complicated legal question turns on such a heinous case. Nobody is on the terrorist\u0026rsquo;s side here, but many reasonable parties are on the side of independence from government intrusion into systems meant to restore the privacy we gave up during the digital revolution.\nWho agrees with Apple here?\nThe tech industry has come out strongly in support of Apple, including Facebook, WhatsApp, and Google. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (an industry privacy watchdog) has announced they will be writing a legal brief in support of Apple. Most privacy scholars side with Apple and legal scholars seem to be split. Whatever happens, this is a fascinating case and it will be fun to watch it unfold.\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/listapp/understanding-the-apple-fbi-encryption-debate/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Understanding the Apple/FBI Encryption Debate"},{"content":"This is inspired by the very existence of @evan.\n🤔 The cynical philosophy of Ecclesiastes — I love this whole book from beginning to end, for all is vanity.\n\u0026ldquo;Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.

It is so full of oddball but thoughtful meta-scifi gems like this:\nWithin a science fictional space, memory and regret are, when taken together, the set of necessary and sufficient elements required to produce a time machine. And of course there\u0026rsquo;s this beauty which I return to all the time:\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re not careful, time will take away everything that ever hurt you, everything you have ever lost, and replace it with knowledge. Time is a machine: it will convert your pain into experience. Raw data will be compiled, will be translated into a more comprehensible language. The individual events of your life will be transmuted into another substance called memory and in the mechanism something will be lost and you will never be able to reverse it, you will never again have the original moment back in its uncategorized, preprocessed state. It will force you to move on and you will not have a choice in the matter.

Maybe I should have said \u0026ldquo;somewhat interesting\u0026rdquo;. But anyway these all interested me!\nDinosaurs ruled the earth for a very very long time.\nModern humans have existed for at least 200,000 years and maybe as long as a million years. Dinosaurs first appeared 232 million years ago and \u0026ldquo;disappeared\u0026rdquo; (if you ignore birds) 65 million years ago. I know this will come as a shock to you but The Land Before Time was highly inaccurate. In this picture, the Stegosaurus on the left had been extinct for over a hundred million years before the Triceratops came into existence. We lived closer to Cera than she to Spike by 30 million years.\nOxford and Cambridge Universities were founded well before the Aztec Empire\nThe Aztec Empire—which we think of as ancient history, the world of Moctezuma and in part the inspiration for the film Apocalypto—ruled what is now southern Mexico until their well-known defeat by Spanish conquistadors in 1521. The empire was formally established with the treaty of the Triple Alliance in 1428. Oxford University began around 1096 and was definitely a real university by 1167. Cambridge University was founded by Oxford academics in 1209 more than 200 years before the Aztecs.\nThe New Testament King Herod reported to Mark Antony\nCleopatra says of Antony, \u0026ldquo;in his livery walked crowns and crownets\u0026rdquo; meaning Kings and Princes. This was literally true and was happening around the time of the life of Jesus. After the defeat of Brutus at the Battle of Phillipi, the triumvirate divided the republic and Judea was within Antony\u0026rsquo;s territory. Herod, the King of Judea who famously ordered the massacre of all young boys in a failed attempt to kill Jesus, was put into power by Mark Antony and later made King of the Jews by the Senate.\n\u0026ldquo;Ancient Egypt\u0026rdquo; isn\u0026rsquo;t a thing. It is three or more relatively distinct things we mush together in our heads.\nThe great pyramids and Sphinx of Giza were built by the Old Kingdom of Egypt around 2,500 BC. The Egyptian Empire, of King Tut and Ramses, existed from 1,500 and 1,100 BC, a thousand years later. And much later, around 50 BC, Cleopatra ended the final 300 year reign of Pharaohs. She was closer to us by a thousand years than to the Sphinx, and she, Tut, and Ramses had no idea what the Sphinx was or who built it. It was pre-history to them. We know far more about these icons today than they did.\nThe Gunpowder Plot influenced Shakespeare.\nIn 1601, the Earl of Essex failed in his attempt to kill Queen Elizabeth. Four years later the famous Gunpowder Plot failed to kill her successor, James I. This was happening while William Shakespeare was actively writing plays. Elizabeth tried to suppress printing and performing of Richard II, whose plot centers on the deposing of a king. And some argue that Shakespeare wrote Macbeth around this time as a clear statement that killing a monarch was a bad idea, to keep the new king off his case.\nThomas Jefferson bought the Louisiana Purchase from Napoleon.\nAll American school children know about the Louisiana Purchase when Thomas Jefferson bought much of the territory that is now the central Unites States from \u0026ldquo;the French\u0026rdquo; for a bargain basement price. We also know about the great French general Napoleon and his aspirations for a European empire. These timelines line up. The purchase was negotiated between Thomas Jefferson and Napoleon, who lost interest in America during his campaign for Europe and sold Louisiana to spite the Spanish.\nPresident John Tyler (born 1790) has living grandchildren.\nThis is more a historical oddity than anything, but Tyler, born during the George Washington presidency, the guy from the \u0026ldquo;Tippecanoe and Tyler Too\u0026rdquo; presidential campaign of 1840 had a child when he was 63 and that child went on to father children of his own at 71 and 75. So Tyler\u0026rsquo;s two grandchildren were born in the 1920s and are still alive today. Needless to say they never knew their grandfather, who died 60 years before they were born.\nJonathan Biss, pianist born 1980, can trace his tutelage quite easily to Beethoven.\nBiss learned to play the Beethoven sonatas starting at age 12 from his teacher, Leon Fleisher, who was himself taught by the great Artur Schnabel. Schnabel studied with Leschetitzky, who was taught by Czerny, who was a student of Beethoven himself. Not shocking per se when you think about the timelines, and Biss is certainly not alone here, but I still think this is very cool.\nShakespeare and the King James Bible are contemporaries.\nThe King James translation of the bible was begun in 1604 and completed in 1611. Shakespeare wrote between around 1590 and 1613. Although he references the bible frequently in his work, it is less noticeable to us because he worked from the Bishop\u0026rsquo;s Bible or from Latin, not from the translation we are most familiar with.\nMozart and Beethoven were early admirers of the under-appreciated Bach.\nMozart was born a few years after Bach died. Unlike Bach, he was a prodigy in his day and highly admired. Bach would have been little-known to the community where Mozart made his mark. But the famously virtuosic Mozart, upon first hearing Bach played, said \u0026ldquo;That is indeed something from which we can learn!\u0026rdquo; Beethoven too called Bach his \u0026ldquo;musical bible.\u0026rdquo; It would be another hundred years before audiences would come to recognize Bach\u0026rsquo;s genius but the great composers were ahead of the curve.\nAside from the Interregnum from 1649-1660 when all theater was banned in England, not a year has gone by in 430 years that Shakespeare wasn\u0026rsquo;t popular and performed regularly.\nShakespeare was wildly popular in his day, and his plays were regularly performed, reprinted, and adapted. The Puritan government of England banned theater for a few years in the 1600s. But after the ban was lifted Shakespeare was again popular and has remained so ever since. Certain plays go in and out of fashion but his work as a whole has never not been popular since it was written over 400 years ago.\nSanta Fe, New Mexico was founded 10 years before the pilgrims landed in New England.\nSanta Fe was founded by Spanish colonists arriving through Mexico and modern Texas in 1610. The Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock in 1620. Santa Fe became an American city by way of the Texas secession from Mexico and maintains its Spanish heritage to this day. Santa Fe has existing buildings that have been continuously occupied for 400 years.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/listapp/mind-bending-relative-time-lines/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Mind Bending Relative Time Lines"},{"content":"I grew up in Indiana and I am here to help you understand the dialect of these mysterious people.\nSwole : Swollen\nEg: \u0026ldquo;My whole foot was swole.\u0026rdquo;\nBusted : Fractured\nEg: \u0026ldquo;He busted his arm.\u0026rdquo;\nWarsh : Wash\nEg: \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s Friday, time to warsh yourself.\u0026rdquo;\nAin\u0026rsquo;t : That is certainly not true\nEg: \u0026ldquo;Obama is a good leader.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;AIN\u0026rsquo;T.\u0026rdquo;\nCollege : He lacks basic common sense because he is educated.\nEg: \u0026ldquo;Wait, hay and straw are two different things?!\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;[looks knowingly at another person] College.\u0026rdquo;\nMa\u0026rsquo;am : You are a woman who is even seven minutes older than me.\nEg: \u0026ldquo;Hello my adult nephew who is in his forties.

Funny, weird, totally distinct, and completely convincing. There never was and never will be anyone really like him.\nMichael Jackson\nChild star, King of Pop, fragile soul, demonized weirdo, consummate entertainer, and possibly the greatest pop dancer who ever lived.\nSteve Jobs\nPart hippie, part visionary, part tyrant, part showman and all genius. The only major corporate CEO in history who spoke straight, cared deeply, cried on stage, and never stopped pushing.\nWilliam Shakespeare\nObviously he\u0026rsquo;s the biggest deal, historically, in English language literature. But a lot of smart people would agree that even if you expand your search world wide, there never has been another like him. Prolific, brilliant, distinctive, and relevant across centuries. (Note: I much prefer other portraits of Shakespeare but I used this hideous thing because @ChrisK wanted an air of authenticity and I love him so I changed it.)\nMichael Jordan\nI\u0026rsquo;m not much of a sports guy. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t tell you who the big stars are right now. But EVERYBODY knew Michael Jordan in his day. He dominated basketball with hard work and talent, and transcended it with brains and business sense.\nChef John of Food Wishes on YouTube\nNot famous per se but Chef John is unpretentious, hilarious, a brilliant cook, and an awesome teacher of technique and recipes. He makes it all about the food which is unique among YouTube chefs. You never even see his face. And he teaches as he cooks. He\u0026rsquo;s definitely made me a better and more confident cook.\nShigeru Miyamoto\nThere are a lot of great video games in the world but they all owe a debt of gratitude to Miyamoto, inventor of (among other things) Mario and Donkey Kong. Miyamoto is smart, playful, insightful, and a total perfectionist. If you grew up on Mario you know that everything about his games feels right. He\u0026rsquo;s one of a kind and I encourage you to read or watch an interview with him.\nTerry gross\nI guess this is a contentious choice but for my money (in exchange for a tote bag and a chance to win an iPad) Terry Gross is the champion of interviews. Considered, well read, respectful, probing, and most of all, willing to let her subjects talk. I\u0026rsquo;ve been listening to her since I was a little kid. Some day she will retire and it will leave a HUGE hole in the interview world.\nTom Waits\nThis one speaks for itself. What is his genre? What kind of music is this? What is his subject matter? What is his voice like? What types of instruments are involved? What are his shows like? How does he interview? The answer to all these questions is simply: Tom Waits.\nTBD: Elon Musk\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a bit premature to put him on this list but I think he\u0026rsquo;s got a shot at being one of a kind in the business world. Obviously brilliant, full of huge ideas, unafraid of risk, and able to raise capital for those risky big ideas. Now we see how well he can execute long term. If he succeeds, there will be nobody like him.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/listapp/singular-talent/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Singular Talent"},{"content":" The Internet was done so well that most people think of it as a natural resource like the Pacific Ocean, rather than something that was man-made.

She is often associated with the coming forth and withdrawal of seasons which has a nice symmetry with Planet Nine\u0026rsquo;s supposed highly eccentric orbit. And it would be a nice nod to poor Pluto, husband to Proserpine. Downside: kind of a ugly name.\nLatona (Leto to the Greeks)\nMistress to Jupiter, she hid herself away to avoid the wrath of his wife Juno, who demanded that everyone shun her. She is also the mother of Apollo the sun, to whom Planet Nine is still bound despite her exile.\nJuno (Hera to the Greeks)\nFitting because she is wife to Jupiter and mother to almost everybody else.

He was so close I couldn\u0026rsquo;t even see his lights. Eventually I got mad and slowed down to about 30. Then he pulled up beside me with his window down and the passenger had his arm out the window with a handgun pointed right at me. I scooted right out of there. 🏃\nNo idea to this day what the deal was with that. But I did learn how fast my car could accelerate.\nI used to live near the office I worked at. The alarm would go off every once in a while and I was the first contact because I could easily hop over and check on things. It was always a false alarm. Once I went and as I got to the top of the stairs I saw the glass door shattered and things scattered about. I scooted right out of there. 🏃\nThis makes you deeply appreciate the Police who went right on in after I ran and hid.\nOnce while riding with my mother in law late at night she accidentally cut a guy off on the freeway. We shrugged it off and then realized several minutes later that he was still behind us. He followed us all the way to my brother in law\u0026rsquo;s house deep in a twisty neighborhood. My MIL was terrified. We scooted right out of there. 🏃\nIt turns out he was the neighbor down the street and it was a giant coincidence.\nWhen I was 17 my friends and I were at Taco Bell eating junk and my friend had parked too close to a Very Creepy Gentleman (TM) with a Purple Heart license plate and a trench coat. He was very angry. We left. Two hours later he pulled into the theater parking lot and approached us as we were getting in the car. We scooted right out of there. 🏃\nScooting right out of there is almost certainly selected for, evolutionarily speaking. I highly recommend it.\nOh yeah and when I was 4 I was hospitalized with asthma and it was apparently a little scary.

Eat a bit of dark chocolate or an apple or peanuts or beef jerky or whatever.\n5:30pm: Make and or finish dinner time permitting. (My wife makes dinner too!) Sometimes I end up working later (and of course sometimes I work all evening but that\u0026rsquo;s not super common.)\nMondays: Try to have family time. Hang with Sophia, watch a movie together, do a project, etc\u0026hellip;\nTuesdays: Once a month I have a book discussion and dinner with my dad. Once a month I have a church appointment. And I usually schedule \u0026ldquo;whatever else\u0026rdquo; on Tuesday nights if possible. Visiting people, helping people with stuff, etc\u0026hellip; And if we\u0026rsquo;re free, have a date night with my wife avoiding Friday night crowds.\nWednesdays: Go to church at 6:45pm with the girls. They have \u0026ldquo;mutual\u0026rdquo; (youth group essentially—crafty stuff, projects, service opportunities, field trips) and I do appointments with church members who need food, commodity, or financial assistance. Usually four-six appointments each Wednesday night. Done by 8:30-9:00.\nThursdays: Once a month I have a church Boy Scout correlation meeting at 7:00 and every Thursday I have another church correlation meeting at 8:30. House cleaners and yard guy come Friday morning so we also tidy any messes Thursday night.\nFridays: Varies. Date night, house projects, family time. Lately we\u0026rsquo;ve been watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer as a family when everyone is home (kind of rare alas.)\n10:00pm: Sophie to bed. If I\u0026rsquo;ve had lots of work interruptions I may do a few hours of focus work. Or clean the kitchen. Or personal projects (tax time here we come\u0026hellip;). At least once or twice a week I try to make time here to read for 1 to 1.5 hours.\n11:30pm: To bed. Ideally. But I\u0026rsquo;m a night owl so these things will cause me to stay up later than I should: A cool list I\u0026rsquo;m writing. A cool work project I\u0026rsquo;m in to. A cool book I\u0026rsquo;m reading. An interesting article I\u0026rsquo;m reading. Tech news I\u0026rsquo;m following. Movie previews I want to watch. Or the existence anywhere of anything even remotely interesting.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it.

I\u0026rsquo;ve listed a lot about books and authors so here I\u0026rsquo;m going to cast a wide net and pick some favorites across the spectrum.\nThe Giving Tree by Shel Silverstein\nMy first true love from before my clear memory begins. I still ❤️ it entirely so I don\u0026rsquo;t want to hear about all your negatives interpretations 😉.\nBeezus and Ramona by Beverley Cleary\nThe best of a perfect series.\nCharlotte\u0026rsquo;s Web by E.B. White\nPerfection.\nSirens of Titan by Kurt Vonnegut\nIt is hard to pick a favorite Vonnegut but this is both great and a little less popular so it seemed a good choice. And it\u0026rsquo;s the purest example of the distinctive juxtaposition of cynicism + humanism in Vonnegut.\nBlood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy\nThis pretty much demands multiple readings and probably some background reading as well but it is a powerful good book.\nThe Denial of Death by Earnest Becker\nA dated but brilliant and very eye opening survey of modern psychological thinking. Possibly this book changed my life.\nLes Miserables by Victor Hugo\nAnother life changer. This book reignited my love of literature after a long spell from mid-high school to early twenties of non fiction reading and not feeling smart enough to read \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; books. Also an absolutely beautiful book.\nAntony and Cleopatra by William Shakespeare\nAgain, hard to pick a favorite but this is probably it. Staggeringly beautiful, thematically powerful, utterly moving.\nHow to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe by Charles Yu\nGotta have some contemporary lit on here so this is my wildcard choice. I love everything about this funny oddball touching book.\nThe Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank\nWe also need a memoir/biography and this tops that list for me.

White privilege is legacy\nI\u0026rsquo;ve read that one of the strongest indicators of success is the success of your father. This powerful boost in outcomes obviously stretches across generations. Membership has if a privileges. And many African Americans in particular have a family history of enslavement.\n2. White privilege is anonymity\nThree of my four great-grandfathers were immigrants, Polish, Irish, and German. I have no doubt they were persecuted in one way or another. But what set them apart from the so called power class was language, culture, dress\u0026hellip; Their children were embarrassed by their crazy immigrant ways. Their grand children were fascinated by their interesting immigrant heritage. White privilege means I have largely forgotten it and can be a member of the power class without raising eyebrows.\n3. White privilege is access\nAccess to trust from fellow citizens and (by extension) law enforcement, access to economic opportunity, access to the benefit of the doubt from people in power who make decisions that impact my life.\n4. White privilege is comfort\nOur racist past was so overt. It became socially unacceptable to be overtly racist, and then my generation grew up genuinely opposed to that kind of racism. We can hardly imagine supporting segregation, name calling, and physical violence motivated by race. The very best part about having white privilege is that I can benefit tremendously as compared to my non-white counterparts, while believing that I am not. Because I wholly reject \u0026ldquo;racism\u0026rdquo; so I\u0026rsquo;m one of the good guys. I would never.\n5. White privilege is membership\nThere are American pastimes and then there are black pastimes. There are American styles of dress and then black dress. American food and black food. This all seemed so normal growing up. We celebrate black culture right? \u0026ldquo;They\u0026rdquo; have tv shows, fashion models, … and good for them! \u0026ldquo;They\u0026rdquo; have such beautiful hair! White privilege is imagining that \u0026ldquo;Black\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;American\u0026rdquo; are two things without realizing the incongruity inherent in that false dichotomy. All this applies to \u0026ldquo;Asian\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Arab\u0026rdquo; too.\n6. White privilege is a call to please go home\nWhite privilege is an armed occupation of a government building followed by two days of discussion and a friendly plea to please go on home to your ranches.\n7. White privilege is reductive\nWhite privilege is listing about white privilege and being A Very Good Guy as if it absolves me of: 1. For most of my young life we locked the car doors in the bad parts of town where \u0026ldquo;bad\u0026rdquo; = \u0026ldquo;black people around\u0026rdquo;. 2. Even today when I sit in a train car full of young black men I notice and feel self conscious. 3. Walking around Harry Potter world every time I see an Asian woman dressed up my brain thinks \u0026ldquo;Cho Chang\u0026rdquo; and I curse myself. I\u0026rsquo;m sorry.\nBut what I\u0026rsquo;d rather talk about is not what white privilege is (and so many of you can tell me that better than I can discern it) but what we can do.\n1. Acknowledge.\nIt is painful to feel like I\u0026rsquo;m a part of something ugly so the temptation to dismiss is real.\n2. Understand.\nOnce we acknowledge the problem we can begin to understand that one can be privileged without knowing it and racist without meaning to be. Much of this probably has its roots in biology: we are in some ways hard-wired to fear \u0026ldquo;different\u0026rdquo;. It kept our ancestors alive for half a million years. But just because it is innate does not mean it is ok. Using reason to overcome our lesser nature is what makes us human.\n3. Change.\nBe open about our privilege, listen to the grievances of people of color, and most importantly teach our children about inequality in all its pernicious forms.\n4. Realize.\nRealize that men in power in America by and large benefit from the privilege of whiteness, maleness, straightness, and wealth. There are powerful economic incentives to resist change. Be skeptical of counterarguments that promote the status quo.\nThese are my thoughts.\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/listapp/white-privilege-is/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"White Privilege Is"},{"content":" That I published my MY AESTHETIC list before the neat new scrolling-thumbnails-in-the-main-feed feature.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all.

It took its first baby steps in the 1940s, was in full swing in the 1970s, and is in its third wave today. Women have been and continue to be instrumental in this change.\nAda Lovelace ~ 1815 –1852\nThis brilliant 19th century mathematician is credited as the world\u0026rsquo;s first computer programmer even though she died a hundred years before the first real computers. Her intuition about the power and applicability of machine computation to many problems even beyond calculation were decades ahead of her peers. The \u0026ldquo;Ada\u0026rdquo; programming language developed by the DoD in the late \u0026rsquo;70s was named in her honor. She was a fascinating academic and a real pioneer and her story deserves to be told more widely.\nIda Rhodes ~ 1900 – 1986\nIda Rhodes\u0026rsquo; influence in the early computer revolution was widespread. She was a programmer, responsible for major early advanced computer systems for, eg, the Social Security Administration. She worked on the design of several nascent programming languages. And she did pioneering work on machine translation of human languages, in particular translating her native Russian to English.\nGrete Hermann ~ 1901 – 1984\nAlthough not a computer scientist, German mathematician Grete Hermann\u0026rsquo;s pioneering work on so called \u0026ldquo;computer algebra\u0026rdquo; is the foundation of the computer science behind some of the most advanced software in existence today. She defined the first algorithms that tackle computational problems symbolically, opening up an entire class of advanced computation to computers for the first time.\nGrace Hopper ~ 1906 – 1992\nThe earliest computer programming languages were extremely low level symbolic codes tied intimately to the type of computer you were working on. If you wanted your stuff to run on a different machine you had to learn a new \u0026ldquo;assembly language\u0026rdquo; and port it meticulously. Grace Hopper pioneered modern \u0026ldquo;compiled\u0026rdquo; programming languages and promoted the now-standard concept of machine independent programming. She had a long and hugely influential career with the US Navy. And she is one of my heroes.\nThe ENIAC Programmers ~ 1943\nThe Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer or ENIAC was the worlds first electronic general purpose computer. And its programmers were all women: Kay McNulty, Betty Jennings, Betty Snyder, Marlyn Wescoff, Fran Bilas and Ruth Lichterman. These women translated mathematical formulae related to military ballistics targeting into computer code and reconfigured the ENIAC to execute the code by adjusting switches and cables, making them the first modern professional programmers.\nJean Sammet ~ 1928 –\nJean Sammet was the first female president of the Association for Computing Machinery, the primary academic computer society. She was also a pioneering programmer and an early scholar in the field of computer languages. She was the first to comprehensively catalog and categorize programming languages, something every modern computer science student studies extensively.\nMary Wilkes ~ 1937 –\nMary Wilkes is an influential pioneer of personal computing. She worked on the LINC project, an early predecessor to the \u0026ldquo;personal\u0026rdquo; computer in an era when computers were room-sized, cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, and were meant to be shared by entire organizations. She programmed the first operating system for a minicomputer and is widely believed to be the first person to use a computer at home.\nMargaret Hamilton ~ 1936 –\nWith self-driving cars in the works, the notion of ultra-high-reliability computer systems is timely. Margaret Hamilton lead the design of the computerized navigation system in the Apollo mission responsible for flying to and landing on the moon. More importantly to the industry, she helped develop the computing concepts still in use today when computer systems demand absolute reliability. The Google Car owes a debt of gratitude to Hamilton and her pioneering work.\nSusan Kare ~ 1954 –\nApple arguably defined modern desktop computing with the release of the Macintosh in 1984, the first comprehensive well considered deep and wide graphical user interface. Artist Susan Kare was the person at Apple who gave that new user interface its visual style. She designed everything from the fonts to the icons to the user interface elements. She went on to Microsoft and beyond, and her clean, friendly, iconic pixel designs were hugely influential and can still be felt in interfaces today.\nSophie Wilson ~ 1957 –\nAll the action in computers today is around mobility: small, connected, power efficient computers like your iPhone. Mobility is made possible by the forward-thinking design of the ARM CPU, a 1990s-born computer chip capable of performing well while using as little power as possible. Sophie Wilson designed the \u0026ldquo;instruction set\u0026rdquo; for ARM, the collection of programming capabilities and operations these chips support, and helped set the stage for this latest sprint in the computation revolution.\nMarissa Mayer ~ 1975 –\nMarissa Mayer was Google employee #20, the first female engineer hired at the male-dominated company in male-dominated Silicon Valley. She rapidly advanced eventually becoming the director responsible for Google\u0026rsquo;s consumer facing web presence — which is to say the part of Google you use every day. She designed Google\u0026rsquo;s search page. She currently has her work cut out for her as the most powerful female CEO in the industry, at Yahoo.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/listapp/women-of-the-computation-revolution/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Women of the Computation Revolution"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve paid my dues.\n1991: I bought a VHS copy in high school so I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to rent it anymore.\n1992: My wife (then girlfriend) bought a VHS copy once I indoctrinated her.\nThese two lived side by side on the shelf when we got married.\n2000: We bought it on DVD when we got a DVD player.\n[2010: My DVD player died and I didn\u0026rsquo;t really want to deal with disks anymore anyway so I ripped a few of my favorite DVDs, including this one, and put them on my network backup drive.]\n2015: I got lazy and bought the iTunes digital download last night.\nI can get out my laptop, load up the movie, and then stream it to my TV but ugh\u0026hellip;now I can just click play with my Apple TV remote without having to get off the couch, the way God intended.\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/listapp/times-my-family-has-purchased-when-harry-met-sally/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Times My Family Has Purchased \"When Harry Met Sally\""},{"content":"Sophia\u0026rsquo;s new posters are 💯% awesome and a perfect addition to her astronomy obsession shrine.

Not sure why I never published this one. I think I was trying to give it a theme or something and abandoned it.\nPermian-Triassic Extinction Event ~ 252 million years ago\nOtherwise known as the \u0026ldquo;Great Dying\u0026rdquo; this is the big one. Over some thousands of years, 96% of marine species and 75% of the terrestrial species went extinct. Evolution would require up to ten million years to re-establish previous levels of biodiversity. This event is complicated and only partially understood, but can probably be attributed to run of bad luck including a major meteor impact, climate changes cause by volcanic activity, and changes in terrain due to continental drift.\nThe Great Oxygenation Event ~ 2.3 billion years ago\nContrary to popular belief, life doesn\u0026rsquo;t need oxygen. Early earth\u0026rsquo;s atmosphere had none at all. Cyanobacteria, the earliest life, created oxygen as a byproduct of metabolism. Eventually this oxygen built up in the atmosphere with two major consequences: First, it was toxic to the anaerobic bacteria. Second, the conversion of atmospheric methane to carbon dioxide lead to a massive ice age. Combined, these almost killed off the Cyanobacteria entirely. They still exist today in very tiny numbers.\nThe Holocene Extinction Event ~ Ongoing\nStarted around 15,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age. Humans are a major contributor to this extinction. Examples of extinctions include mammoths, the famous dodo, the passenger pigeon, and many plants.\n[?] Pliocene Supernova ~ 2 millions years ago\nThere is some evidence that a supernova of a nearby star may have stripped the earth of its ozone layer two million years ago resulting in widespread extinction of some marine life.\nThe Late Devonian Extinction ~ 360 million years ago\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t know much about this one, but it happened slowly and killed about half of all species on earth.\nCretaceous–Paleogene Extinction ~ 66 million years ago\nBye bye dinosaurs.\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/listapp/global-extinctions-ranked/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Global Extinctions, Ranked 📂"},{"content":"This draft is so old it predates the open list feature.

If you have a smoker or have access to one, this is easy, fun, delicious, and people will think you\u0026rsquo;re amazing 💅🏽\nGet some meat\nLots of recipes and blogs claim a bone-in shoulder has better flavor. I once made three shoulders at once for a party and happened to have one bone-in and two boneless and I\u0026rsquo;m here to tell you it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter. Get whatever you can find. Here in Phoenix, my favorite butcher hast great bone-in and Costco has great boneless with a very good price.\nPrepare your spice rub\nI like to keep it very simple. The smoked meat itself should be the standout flavor so I don\u0026rsquo;t use complicated rubs. My personal go-to is: 1/2 Cup Kosher Salt + 3 Tbsp Black Pepper + 1 Tbsp Cayenne Pepper + 1/2 Tsp Smoked Paprika. This gives a nice clean spice and a touch of smokiness to enhance the flavor of the meat without adding much flavor of its own.\nPat the meat dry.\nUsing lots of paper towel, pat the meat all over and between all the flappy bits to remove excess moisture.\nOil and salt the meat\nRub the meat all over with olive oil and then sprinkle on the rub and pat it in so it binds well. Get in there thoroughly between all the flaps. IMPORTANT: Use lots of salt. More than you think you need. I had 1/2 cup of kosher salt in this rub and I used almost all of it on a 6.5 pound shoulder. This salt will produce a flavorful salty bark that, once shredded, will season all that meat you aren\u0026rsquo;t getting salt on. It needs to be salty.\nRest the meat.\nLet the rubbed meat sit uncovered in the fridge for a few hours up to over night. I put mine on a wire rack set in a cookie sheet so any moisture can drip away. This helps form a good bark by drying out the exterior of the meat. IMPORTANT: In the fridge please.\nPrepare and stabilize the smoker.\nFollow the instructions for your smoker. Aim for 190-200F temperature. For smoke, choose something mild like apple, cherry, or maybe oak. I\u0026rsquo;m not a big fan of the strong woods like hickory and mesquite but even if you are, they\u0026rsquo;re too overpowering for pork. Use plenty of the chunk type wood. Chips are too short-burning for big hunks of meat. I used five big chunks.\nPlace the meat in the smoker naked.\nStart the meat off right on the grill/grate unwrapped. If your smoker has an optional indirect heating plate you definitely want to use it. We\u0026rsquo;re going for even heat all around, not grilling from below. Don\u0026rsquo;t bother with apple juice or a pan of water or whatever. None of those things make any difference.\nSmoke for a few hours until the internal temperature reaches about 150F.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to be super precise here. I\u0026rsquo;ve done it enough I don\u0026rsquo;t even use a thermometer for this part. We\u0026rsquo;re looking for a dryish outside bark and a firm feeling. 140-165F is fine so no stress if you mess up a bit!\nWrap tightly and continue smoking.\nNow that we have a good bark we need to arrest the loss of moisture by wrapping the meat tightly. A double layer of heavy duty aluminum foil works great. Or if you have it you can use the large heavy duty parchment paper. You want it well covered and well sealed. Don\u0026rsquo;t skimp!\nSmoke for another few hours until the internal temperature reaches about 195F.\nWithin reason the higher you go the more tender it is. (NOTE: This is not true with other meats or cuts. Just pork shoulder.) 180 will be almost sliceable. 195 will be toothy, moist and easily shreddable with forks (my preference). 205 will be tender enough to just pull off a pile with tongs that falls apart. Eventually it will get mushy but you have a big range here so NO STRESS. Expect total cooking time to be about 45 minutes to an hour per pound but plan for a little longer just in case.\nWrap in a towel and put it in a cooler to rest.\nTHIS IS NOT OPTIONAL. It is critical that the meat rests to even out the temperature and reincorporate moisture. An unrested shoulder is stringy. A rested shoulder is melt-in-your-mouth perfect. Just leave it wrapped in foil or parchment, wrap an old towel around it and put it in a cooler. I keep one just for this purpose. The styrofoam ones at the grocery will also be fine. The cooler will keep it piping hot. It should rest for an hour if possible and it will hold well for several hours.\nTake a peek and a bite!\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;re ready to serve, unwrap and take a peek. IMPORTANT: Using a fork or tongs you should now sneak a little bite. Then transfer the meat to a serving platter, crock pot, or whatever. Using two forks, shred it to the texture you prefer, mixing the bark into the meat and pulling out large pieces of fat and membranes as you go. NOTE: Coming out of the cooler it may smell kind of gross (like cigarettes) but the meat won\u0026rsquo;t be this way at all. I think it is just smoke + hot plastic.\nServe.\nI like mine with white onion, pickles, and jalapeños. Warm corn tortillas or soft white buns are great. If you or your guests want barbecue sauce, more power to you. Or use the pork in other interesting things like steamed buns, tacos, salad or anything else @rachaelray dreams up.

Inspired by people inspired by @ChrisK.\nAnd suddenly the memory revealed itself.\nThe taste was that of the little piece of madeleine which on Sunday mornings at Combray (because on those mornings I did not go out before mass), when I went to say good morning to her in her bedroom, my aunt Léonie used to give me, dipping it first in her own cup of tea or tisane.\nThe sight of the little madeleine had recalled nothing to my mind before I tasted it; perhaps because I had so often seen such things in the meantime, without tasting them, on the trays in pastry-cooks\u0026rsquo; windows, that their image had dissociated itself from those Combray days to take its place among others more recent;\nperhaps because of those memories, so long abandoned and put out of mind, nothing now survived, everything was scattered;\nthe shapes of things, including that of the little scallop-shell of pastry, so richly sensual under its severe, religious folds, were either obliterated or had been so long dormant as to have lost the power of expansion which would have allowed them to resume their place in my consciousness.\nBut when from a long-distant past nothing subsists,\nafter the people are dead,\nafter the things are broken and scattered,\ntaste and smell alone, more fragile but more enduring, more unsubstantial, more persistent, more faithful, remain poised a long time,\nlike souls,\nremembering,\nwaiting,\nhoping,\namid the ruins of all the rest;\nand bear unflinchingly, in the tiny and almost impalpable drop of their essence, the vast structure of recollection.\nAnd as soon as I had recognized the taste of the piece of madeleine soaked in her decoction of lime-blossom which my aunt used to give me (although I did not yet know and must long postpone the discovery of why this memory made me so happy)…\nimmediately the old grey house upon the street, where her room was, rose up like a stage set to attach itself to the little pavilion opening on to the garden which had been built out behind it for my parents (the isolated segment which until that moment had been all that I could see);\nand with the house the town,\nfrom morning to night and in all weathers,\nthe Square where I used to be sent before lunch,\nthe streets along which I used to run errands,\nthe country roads we took when it was fine.\nAnd as in the game wherein the Japanese amuse themselves by filling a porcelain bowl with water and steeping in it little pieces of paper which until then are without character or form…\nbut, the moment they become wet, stretch and twist and take on colour and distinctive shape, become flowers or houses or people, solid and recognizable…\nso in that moment all the flowers in our garden and in M. Swann\u0026rsquo;s park,\nand the water-lilies on the Vivonne\nand the good folk of the village\nand their little dwellings\nand the parish church\nand the whole of Combray and its surroundings,\ntaking shape and solidity,\nsprang into being, town and gardens alike,\nfrom my cup of tea.\n.\nLink\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/listapp/all-these-lists-about-childhood-smells/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"All These Lists About Childhood Smells…"},{"content":"I love to bake\u0026hellip;\nSophia always asks for pineapple upside down cake.\nSo delicious and perfect for December.\nIsabel (@imc) has a summer birthday and usually wants fresh berry tart with pastry cream.\nDelicious AND beautiful.

Seeing as he is Hercules he gives the tortoise a 100 yard head start. The race begins with the tortoise walking slowly and Hercules in an all out sprint. Soon Hercules has run 100 yards and reached the tortoise\u0026rsquo;s starting point. But by now the tortoise has walked ahead some. Hercules must now catch up to that point. When he does, obviously the tortoise has walked further still. It is clear Hercules can never catch up.\nGalileo\u0026rsquo;s Paradox\n9 squared is 81. 10 squared is 100. All the numbers from 82 to 99 are not perfect squares. In this way it can easily be shown that for every square there are many numbers that are not squares. But any number can be squared. So there is clearly one square for every non-square number. So there are both more non squares than squares and an equal number of both.\nThe Raven Paradox\nThe claim: all ravens are black. As evidence we have all the black ravens we\u0026rsquo;ve seen in our lives. How about this claim: all non-black things are not ravens. Again we have as evidence all the non-black things we\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen, none of which were ravens. These two claims are logically identical. Therefore, the existence of your white refrigerator is evidence that all ravens are black. And your red car. And your blue shoes. Still more evidence that all ravens are black. ?!\nThe Unexpected Hanging Paradox\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve been sentenced to hang. The judge promises that the executioner will knock on your door one day next week at noon and it will be a surprise. You return to your cell and think a bit. If Thursday noon passes safely then you\u0026rsquo;ll know it must be Friday, and then the knock won\u0026rsquo;t be a surprise so it can\u0026rsquo;t be Friday. But then by the same logic it can\u0026rsquo;t be Thursday either. Or Wednesday… You conclude logically that you can\u0026rsquo;t be hung. The executioner shows up Thursday and you are indeed surprised.\nThe Interesting Number Paradox\nWhat is the smallest number that is not interesting? One is interesting because it is the first. Two is the smallest even number. Three is the first odd prime. Four is a perfect square. But if we keep going up, there will certainly be some numbers that are not interesting in any way. Which one is the smallest? But wait! Being the smallest uninteresting number is kind of interesting! So it isn\u0026rsquo;t the smallest uninteresting number anymore. But that was the only thing that made it interesting…\nBerry Paradox\nSimilar to the one above. What is the smallest number not nameable in under ten words? Whatever it is, you can certainly name it \u0026ldquo;the smallest number not nameable in under ten words\u0026rdquo; which is nine words.\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/listapp/some-fun-paradoxes-ranked/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Some Fun Paradoxes, Ranked"},{"content":"It\u0026rsquo;s a little cloudy out so of course I drove by three accidents on the way home from the airport.\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/fb/its-a-little-cloudy-out-so-of-course-i/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":""},{"content":"You know the movie The Emperor\u0026rsquo;s New Groove?

I\u0026rsquo;m no expert but to me this is how the genre family tree looks. Hop on the 400 year romantic comedy train.\nMuch Ado About Nothing ~ 1598\nThis play is ostensibly a retelling of a classic story of love and deception, but the Beatrice/Benedict \u0026ldquo;subplot\u0026rdquo; is, as far as we know, Shakespeare\u0026rsquo;s invention. And really it is the main plot: the one we are most invested in, the one into which Shakespeare puts his theatrical genius, and perhaps the original modern romantic comedy. Consider the Kenneth Branagh film for a wonderful classic take, or Joss Whedon\u0026rsquo;s delightful modernization. Or even better: Both.\nPride and Prejudice ~ 1813\nIgnore for a moment that this is the story of marrying off your daughters to rich men and let the incredible wit and charm sink in. With its strong independent female lead this story is surprisingly modern; so much so that you can\u0026rsquo;t help but think it influenced every rom com that came after. It\u0026rsquo;s a time commitment but consider the BBC/A\u0026amp;E 6 hour miniseries version which is beautifully produced and a perfectly acted by Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth and Colin Firth as Darcy.\nBringing up Baby ~ 1938\nThis is a slapstick take on the form and a little insufferable for it. But it\u0026rsquo;s an early Hollywood take on the genre with big stars and all the fundamentals of the romantic comedy.\nBreakfast at Tiffany\u0026rsquo;s ~ 1961\nIn this twist on the form the block our lovers face is endogenous. She\u0026rsquo;s broken and so is he and I suppose neither believes they deserve the love they want. It\u0026rsquo;s a powerful take on the trope fueled by Capote\u0026rsquo;s literary genius (although the novella it\u0026rsquo;s based on is not technically a romcom since in that version the lovers don\u0026rsquo;t make it.)\nWhen Harry Met Sally ~ 1989\nThe romcom was out of fashion for a long time before this brilliant film resurrected it with more modern themes. To me this is the very best modern romantic comedy and it holds up amazingly well for a 30 year old film. It\u0026rsquo;s also reconnects to the past, more closely hewing to the Much Ado/Pride and Prejudice model than earlier films. If you\u0026rsquo;ve never seen it do yourself a favor and watch it this weekend.\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ~ 2004\nAfter the incredible success of Harry and Sally romcoms became sure fire studio wins and that brought a typical derivative Hollywood race to the bottom in terms of quality and story. This was one of the first films I think really brought something fresh with its sci-fi undertones and inspired subversion of the standard form. It\u0026rsquo;s a classic romcom in the fundamentals but structurally entirely unique. It helps that it is also beautifully acted by Jim Carey and Kate Winslet.\nCastaway on the Moon ~ 2009\nThe Korean film industry brings us this thoroughly original take where our lost and lonely lovers are frustrated in their cute-meet by their total isolation from the world and (almost) from each other. It is fresh, funny, touching, and relevant.\nSilver Linings Playbook ~ 2012\nSilver Linings Playbook did for the 2010s what Harry and Sally did for the 80s, making the standard cute-meet setup thoroughly relevant to a mixed up conflicted and fundamentally lost generation unsure anymore what it even means to be sane.\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/listapp/rom-coms-worth-watching/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Rom Coms Worth Watching"},{"content":"Inspired by @hels, highly opinionated. Meant to be an open list with just a couple entries but I got carried away.\nAmerican Pastoral by Philip Roth\nRoth is widely regarded as one of the great modern American novelists and this book is thoroughly engrossing and highly relevant to fractured American culture.\nThe Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank\nIt is impossible not to love this book. Funny, moving, intimate, and breathtakingly sad. It is a must read for all modern humans and difficult to put down once you start.\nFahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury\nShort, intriguing, fast paced, and a little cranky.\nCharlotte\u0026rsquo;s Web by E.B. White\nThe classic children\u0026rsquo;s lit entry on this list and one of the most beautiful books ever written.\nThe Odyssey by Homer translated by Robert Fagles\nThis is a less-stuffy versified translation that makes the reading really fun. And of course this story, although it is ancient, could easily pass for a modern action film.\nAll the Pretty Horses by Cormac McCarthy\nMcCarthy\u0026rsquo;s masterpiece Blood Meridian is the real must read but it probably doesn\u0026rsquo;t meet the \u0026ldquo;easy to get in to\u0026rdquo; requirement. So start here instead with this beautiful story of loss, love, and the vanished American west.\nCatch-22 by Joseph Keller\nI don\u0026rsquo;t actually like this book much but it\u0026rsquo;s an undisputed classic and an easy engaging read.\nMy Antonia by Willa Cather\nThis early 20th century classic novel takes as its subject lower class immigrant girls which the National Endowment for the Arts called \u0026ldquo;a radical aesthetic move.\u0026rdquo; It is also a touching story that\u0026rsquo;s easy to enjoy.\nThe Heart is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers\nThis perennial entrant on \u0026ldquo;best English language novels\u0026rdquo; lists is staggeringly moving, beautifully written, and deeply humane. It is most remarkable to realize that McCullers was just 23 years old when it was published.\nPride and Prejudice by Jane Austen\nNot everyone\u0026rsquo;s cup of tea but worth a shot. Despite its dated subject matter it is eminently readable and very funny. And Eliza Bennet is one of the truly great female leads in literature.\nSlaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut\nA short fast read that leaves you speechless. This is Vonnegut\u0026rsquo;s masterpiece and a perfect example of his signature meta-fiction, dry humor, and deep humanity.\nThe Feminine Mystique by Betty Friedan\nRemarkable in part because of its historical significance and in part because of its modernity. You\u0026rsquo;ll be amazed how well Friedan\u0026rsquo;s characterization of feminism fits current thinking sixty years later, and a little disheartened at how long we\u0026rsquo;ve known better.\nThe Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald\nIf you didn\u0026rsquo;t read this in high school you must read it soon. And if you did, it\u0026rsquo;s worth another read later in life. Brilliant book plain and simple.\nThe Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a Hemingway classic you can read in a day. What\u0026rsquo;s not to like? And it is jam-packed with wisdom and beauty.\nTrue Grit by Charles Portis\nMaybe not a classic but a gem of a book, with such a distinctive and appealing voice that you can\u0026rsquo;t put it down. And of course it has a place in American culture by way of John Wayne.\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/listapp/books-that-are-really-good-and-culturally-meritorious-but-also-not-terribly-difficult-to-get-in-to/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Books That Are Really Good and Culturally Meritorious, but Also Not Terribly Difficult to Get in To"},{"content":" My lists will never trend again.\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/listapp/revised-opinion-on-list-app-going-public/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Revised Opinion on List App Going Public"},{"content":" I\u0026rsquo;m cool with this.\nLove you all.\nBut the more the merrier, you know?\nHopefully we can keep the trolls at bay.\nJust remember for every jerk out there, there are thousands of wonderful people.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve got this.\nThanks @bjnovak @dev and @ChrisK its been fun.\nThanks to way too many list app users for sharing.

Our story takes place many years ago. But now, as then, he is a man of great passions.\nWhen I was 14 we took a trip to Sanibel Island in Florida. My sisters were in college so it was just mom, dad, my brother and I.\nOne day we decided to visit a nature preserve. We learned that it was a breeding ground for the endangered Roseate Spoonbill.\nThere were signs about the spoonbill. They explained that this majestic animal was threatened because it\u0026rsquo;s breeding area was dwindling.\nThey explained that this preserve was one of the few places left in the United States for these birds to nest.\nThey explained that the Roseate Spoonbill was a rare natural treasure.\nAs we rounded a corner in the park we came to a small bank on the inlet. There were three spoonbills standing at a distance in the still water.\nIt was silent. My father was moved by the scene.\n\u0026ldquo;Boys, boys look\u0026rdquo; he said. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if his eyes were welling with tears but I like to think they were.\nWe stood on the sandy bank and admired the birds.\nDad knelt between us, put his arms around our shoulders.\n\u0026ldquo;This is a special moment\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;These beautiful birds are endangered. Their numbers are dwindling.\u0026rdquo;\nHe squeezed us close as we watched together. \u0026ldquo;The day is not far off that they may be gone forever.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd then he said with great reverence: \u0026ldquo;You will never see this many Roseate Spoonbills at the same time for the rest of your lives.\u0026rdquo;\nWe watched the three lonely spoonbills for a second more. But only a second.\nBecause we were distracted by a strange sound in the distance. It grew louder.\nIt became a cacophony.\nAnd then from behind the trees far across the water a great dark mass rose up.\nThe noise grew deafening.\nThe sky grew dark.\nThousands of Roseate Spoonbills filled the sky.\nThey filled our field of view, drowned out the silence, and settled in their great abundance on the trees, on the bank, and in the water.

Surely the most likely outcome was extinction.\nBut it was their last best hope and so they walked on toward the lava caves of eastern Wyoming.

I love that each member of my family has a personal favorite dish, and they\u0026rsquo;re all different. I love the colors and the decadence. I love it all.\nI love that everyone is happy.\nWe share the table and nobody is stressed. It is all laughter and love.\nI love the weather.\nFall is my favorite time.

This would of course yield devastating results except that you are still in North Carolina so, like, the cavalry\u0026rsquo;s coming, baby. You\u0026rsquo;ll be ok.\nNew Orleans\nThis all looks familiar to long-time residents.

Also, all the signs warning that consumption of raw brains is known to the state of California to be detrimental to your health may have some positive impact.\nNew York\nDestruction spreads slowly but consistently in New York primarily because nobody seems to notice. Attempts to rebuff zombies with an angry \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m waking here\u0026rdquo; prove surprisingly effective for a while but eventually fail.

Some people say this may actually be a problem and there\u0026rsquo;s apparently a test I can take to be sure I have antibodies. I should probably do that.\nSeasonal Allergies\nI had seasonal allergies once. It was terrible. But it went away and never came back. My wife and daughters still have to Claritin up every spring but I don\u0026rsquo;t. No idea why not.\nCold Season\nMy wife and kids get sick three times for every time I\u0026rsquo;m sick, I\u0026rsquo;m never sick more than a day, and my body conveniently only gets sick on the weekend and never when I\u0026rsquo;m busy. I never have to miss work or other responsibilities.\nDrug side effects\nI always read all that side effect stuff about loss of appetite or muscle cramps or whatever and then I think, \u0026ldquo;hmm, is it happening?!\u0026rdquo; But it never is. I guess Dramamine makes me sleepy so maybe that counts.\nHeadaches\nI guess I\u0026rsquo;ve had a headache before. Like if I\u0026rsquo;m way hungry or dehydrated. But it never hurts that much. I\u0026rsquo;ve probably taken a pain killer twice in ten years.\nComputer problems\nI\u0026rsquo;m one of those super-annoying people where the computer doesn\u0026rsquo;t work right five times in a row and then you call me over and I push the same button you were pushing and suddenly it works fine. I think this is because the computer respects me.\nSwine flu\nI got the swine flu last year. Everybody around me who got it was sick for days. I was really sick but only for a day and a half and then I was fine.\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/listapp/things-that-are-bad-for-most-people-but-mild-for-me/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Things That Are Bad for Most People but Mild for Me"},{"content":"This is a partial list.

I still believe that in a Midwestern accent this spelling more closely matches the pronunciation.\nSchedule\nIn 4th grade my teacher had those cartoony classroom decorations and one of them had this word. I spent all year trying to sort out what it spelled. It was a year or two later before I realized that\u0026rsquo;s how you spell \u0026ldquo;schedule\u0026rdquo;.\nCoed Naked Lacrosse\nA girl at camp had this on a T-shirt. I was pretty sure I knew vaguely what Lacrosse was, but I thought those first two words were one syllable each: code nake\u0026rsquo;d lacrosse.\nJewelry\nI remember sitting at my desk for ten minutes trying to figure out how to spell this word (Google didn\u0026rsquo;t always exist, kiddos). In my defense, we Hoosiers pronounce it \u0026ldquo;jew-luh-ree\u0026rdquo; which is not at all how it\u0026rsquo;s spelled.\nPOW*MIA\nI would see these window stickers on the backs of cars and I decided it must be a summer camp of some kind: Pow-me-uh. Yeah, sounds like a summer camp.\nTill\nTill is a contracted \u0026ldquo;until\u0026rdquo; so it obviously only has one L right? Well it turns out if you spell it that way several times in a big company wide email at work you will get teased.\nSubtlety\nThis word is such a spelling hot mess I just avoid ever typing it. Because those letters up there clearly spell sub-tu-letty.\nTomorrow\nWhen I was a kid my uncle told me, \u0026ldquo;just remember Tom or Row!\u0026rdquo; and for some crazy reason it worked. I\u0026rsquo;ve never had trouble since.\nCoathanger\nIn my defense, my iPhone says that isn\u0026rsquo;t even a word so maybe I was actually right all those years ago when I read it as \u0026ldquo;coath-anger\u0026rdquo; and my dad laughed and laughed.\nCondemn\nNote to 7th graders reading aloud in class: not pronounced like condom.\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/listapp/spelling-my-private-battle/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Spelling: My Private Battle"},{"content":" I Will Follow\nLink\nSunday Bloody Sunday\nLink\nBad\nLink\nPride (In the Name of Love)\nLink\nWire\nLink\nWhere The Streets Have No Name\nLink\nI Still Haven\u0026rsquo;t Found What I\u0026rsquo;m Looking For\nLink\nOne\nLink\nMysterious Ways\nLink\nIn a Little While\nLink\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/listapp/iconic-u2-guitar-hooks/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Iconic U2 Guitar Hooks"},{"content":"I work at the library when my house is noisy and sometimes I need to do a phone call so I reserve a private room.

Also it skews heavily toward stuff around my house. But everything on this list is 💯. I guarantee it.\nBest Bread: Mediterra Bakehouse\nTechnically this is in Coolidge, not Phoenix, but you can find them at the public market on Saturday mornings and Wednesday afternoons and they have a few varieties at Whole Foods. Mediterra bakes the best bread in Phoenix bar none, and very very good bread in general. They specialize in sourdough with many options. My favorite is the Fire Bread. Their specialty breads are also all excellent. Link\nBest Unpretentious Sushi: Hana Japanese Eatery\nBe careful because there is also a place called Hana in Tempe but it is unrelated. The real Hana is simple-but-nice, clean, friendly very casual place a mile from my house. Remember you\u0026rsquo;re a thousand miles from the ocean so don\u0026rsquo;t just order whatever you want. Instead ask if anything is very special today. They\u0026rsquo;ll often say yes. And follow them on Twitter if you want to know asap when they get something interesting. Warning: BYOB.\nBest Sweets: Urban Cookies Bakeshop\nThis husband-wife team (now grown up a bit) bakes the best cookies I\u0026rsquo;ve ever tasted outside a home kitchen. Big, chewy-crisp, decadently buttery. They have a selection of gluten-free baked goods that are absolutely good enough to sell without that warning label. Oh and for the cupcake crowd, theirs are the only cupcakes I even like.\nBest Comfort Food: Mrs. White\u0026rsquo;s Golden Rule Cafe\nButtermilk-marinated hand-battered fried chicken cooked to order in a little pot in the back by the 80 year old Mrs. White and her progeny. I don\u0026rsquo;t even like fried chicken much but this stuff is powerfully good. Of course they have sticky-sweet cornbread, sweet tea, collard greens, and all the rest. If your lucky they\u0026rsquo;ll have tomato cobbler. I asked when they have it and he said, \u0026ldquo;Oh, when Mrs. White feels like making it.\u0026rdquo;\nBest Barbecue: Little Miss Barebcue\nThree years ago \u0026ldquo;Best barbecue in Phoenix\u0026rdquo; would have required a giant disclaimer, but Little Miss Barbecue put real barbecue on the Phoenix map. The owner runs the giant smokers all day and night so they can serve no-frills-absolutely-perfect brisket, ribs, homemade sausage, pork butt, turkey, and—on Thursdays—from-scratch pastrami. Sides are a simple affair: beans, slaw, and grits. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget the Mexican coke. Expect 20 to 40 minutes in line.\nBest Lunch Salad: Windsor\nI eat salads for lunch a lot because they can be interesting and unrepetitive wile staying relatively healthy. Windsor\u0026rsquo;s salads are fresh and delicious and relatively cheap. Added bonus: a short walk from my house. Warning: this place is too loud for my tastes at dinner time.\nBest Pizza: Pizzaria Bianco\nThis is not just the best pizza in Phoenix. It\u0026rsquo;s some of the best pizza in America. Chris Bianco is the first ever James Beard award winning pizza chef and he\u0026rsquo;s something of a local legend. He makes the cheese in house. He co-owns the tomato farm and the tomato cannery. They also have an incredible always-different antipasti with the best of whatever\u0026rsquo;s available beautifully presented. Oh and killer desserts. Pro tip: The Camelback location is roomy and takes reservations.\nBest Burger: Delux Burger\nDon\u0026rsquo;t get the stupid fancy one with arugula and crap on bread with an Italian name. Just get the basic burger: lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese if that\u0026rsquo;s your persuasion, on an egg bun. This burger is A+++. Neiman ranch beef, good bun, real cheese, and fresh greens.\nBest Ice Cream: Churn\nThis used to be an easy call when Crave was still around. Their fresh mint chocolate chip was the most delicious ice cream I ever tasted: fresh, slightly floral with big chunks of chocolate. But Crave didn\u0026rsquo;t survive the recession. We have lots of fancy places: Gelato Spot, Sweet Republic…But for stock-standard ice cream in normal flavors, Churn is the best. Warning: they\u0026rsquo;ve become popular recently so there\u0026rsquo;s a huge line on weekends. Ice cream isn\u0026rsquo;t worth a wait for me but maybe it is for you.\nBest Bagels: Everything Bagels\nI used to drive all the way to Chandler for bagels from Bagel Man. I still recommend him 100% — super friendly and great bagels — but Everything Bagels on 16th north of Bethaney Home are just as good and so much more convenient. Chewy dense slightly crusty made fresh daily. Go before 11:00 am because when they sell out they\u0026rsquo;re done.\nBest Butcher: Hobe Meats\nThis tiny place on 16th street has fantastic meats and a friendly staff. It\u0026rsquo;s pricey but I\u0026rsquo;ve never been disappointed. The chorizo is unreal. Great pork chops, steaks, and roasts. And order your thanksgiving turkey too. They used to have killer house made beef jerky but the last time I got it it wasn\u0026rsquo;t the same. Not sure what happened.\nBest Sausage: Knockwurst from Schreiner\u0026rsquo;s\nThis little sausage maker is a local treasure and their short fat Knockwurst are such a treat. Grill them til they split and eat them on a bun. Like a hot dog\u0026rsquo;s platonic form. They also have fantastic house-made sauerkraut and a great assortment of pickles and mustards and stuff.\nBest Chicago Dog: Great Dane\u0026rsquo;s Dog House\nSteel your stomach because this place is off-puttingly dingy with its ugly dog decor, dim lighting, and general not-very-clean vibe. \u0026ldquo;Today\u0026rsquo;s Special\u0026rdquo; has been two dogs for $5 for about 25 years so I don\u0026rsquo;t expect it to change tomorrow. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing special here. Just a good quality boiled or grilled dog on a steamed bun with your choice of toppings. And you can just say \u0026ldquo;Chicago\u0026rdquo; to get it done right.\nBest Chilly Treat: Snoh Ice Shavery\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re gauche like me you probably ignore this place thinking its like snow cones or whatever. But it is actually some kind of Taiwanese thing that is interesting, fun, delicious, and not terribly unhealthy (for a frozen treat). The \u0026ldquo;ice\u0026rdquo; is fluffy, not very sweet, and comes in several flavors. It sounds weird but top it with condensed milk (along with assorted fruits, candies, cookies, and jellies) to kick up the sweet a little. We plan to try the \u0026ldquo;brick toast\u0026rdquo; soon.\n(Bonus) Best Mechanic: Hon-Man Auto Care\nNot food but just as important. We\u0026rsquo;ve been taking our cars to Hon-Man for 15 years, since the owner Tait first opened a little shop in Tempe. He now owns the whole building, has expanded to Flagstaff, and lives in back of the shop. He\u0026rsquo;s completely competent, movingly honest, super friendly, and (my wife assures me) a total hottie. He now has a big staff so don\u0026rsquo;t expect to see him necessarily but the service is always A+++.

No. \u0026ldquo;Though as for that the passing there / Had worn them really about the same, / And both that morning equally lay / In leaves no step had trodden black.\u0026rdquo; It pointedly makes fun of our tendency to think past decisions are more important than they really are. \u0026ldquo;I shall be telling this with a sigh somewhere ages and ages hence…And that has made all the difference.\u0026rdquo; Indeed.\nIf music is the food of love, play on.\nBecause I love being in love and I want to feed my love! Play! Play! Play! Ahh yummy love! Lol no. The next line: \u0026ldquo;Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting, the appetite may sicken and so die.\u0026rdquo; The notion that music is the \u0026ldquo;food of love\u0026rdquo; is proverbial and Shakespeare subverts this by having the Duke ask to be so overfed on it that he becomes sickened turning his love for Olivia into disgust. He\u0026rsquo;s tired of being in love.\nSound and fury\nOften said to express power, rage, or impending doom, this phrase originates from Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s powerful soliloquy at the end of the play about futility and meaninglessness: \u0026ldquo;Life\u0026rsquo;s but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more. It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury signifying nothing.\u0026rdquo; Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s sound and fury is, he says, a worthless pretense.\nWherefore art thou Romeo?\nI\u0026rsquo;m sure none of you smart people are confused about this one but it was pervasive enough in the past that even the late brilliant Roger Ebert got it wrong in his review of Zeffirelli\u0026rsquo;s 1968 Romeo and Juliet: \u0026ldquo;not one single person found it necessary to snicker when Juliet asked so simply where Romeo was.\u0026rdquo; The thing is, Roger, (and I\u0026rsquo;m telling you this because I love you) when Juliet asks, \u0026ldquo;wherefore art thou Romeo\u0026rdquo; she isn\u0026rsquo;t asking where, she\u0026rsquo;s asking why. Why does he have to be Romeo?\nThee, Thy, Thou, and Thine\nThese are the pronouns they used to use to refer to superiors when being highly formal, right? You\u0026rsquo;re forgiven for thinking so because your teacher taught you this, but it\u0026rsquo;s wrong. Actually these were the informal pronouns used for inferiors and equals. You and Your were reserved for formal situations. We\u0026rsquo;re probably so confused about this because the place we most typically see these is the King James Bible, where they were paradoxically chosen for a less formal more intimate tone.\nYour clock goes slower near the speed of light\nThis is true, but the implication is usually totally confused by people who talk about it. And that\u0026rsquo;s ok because the real truth is incomprehensibly counter-intuitive. What your teacher said: If a man takes off in a spaceship going close to the speed of light, his watch will tick more slowly and he\u0026rsquo;ll age more slowly than people on earth. What they left out: the watches on earth will also tick more slowly than the astronaut\u0026rsquo;s and they\u0026rsquo;ll age slower than him. How can both be true? Relativity.\nImmaculate Conception\nThis Catholic concept has nothing to do with the virgin birth of Jesus. It is rather the notion that Jesus\u0026rsquo;s mother Mary was herself conceived free from original sin, the otherwise-pervasive stain of the fall of man through Adam\u0026rsquo;s transgression inherited by all mankind.\nPapal Infallibility\nWhile we\u0026rsquo;re taking about Catholicism, contrary to oft-repeated claims by non-Catholics, the Pope does not profess to be infallible. Infallibility only applies to the Pope\u0026rsquo;s teachings under very specific circumstances and the church only recognizes two such infallible teachings in the last 200 years.\nYe Olde Shoppe\nThe word \u0026ldquo;The\u0026rdquo; has never been pronounced \u0026ldquo;ye\u0026rdquo;. Old English had extra letters including \u0026ldquo;thorn\u0026rdquo; (þ) which fell out of favor in modern English. But the common word \u0026ldquo;the\u0026rdquo; continued to be abbreviated with a thorn + a superscripted letter e. In common 16th century handwriting, this abbreviation looks very much like \u0026ldquo;ye\u0026rdquo; but it was always pronounced \u0026ldquo;the\u0026rdquo; like it is today.\nHighly evolved\nIn so far as all life on earth stems from a unified genetic history (and we believe that to be true), every living thing is equally \u0026ldquo;evolved\u0026rdquo;. Humans are not more evolved than monkeys or pigs or moss. Evolution has no goal, intelligence is not an endpoint of evolution, and what is highly advantageous today may be severely problematic tomorrow (see Dinosaurs). Also, humans did not evolve from modern monkeys. We evolved from ancient chimpanzees, and so did modern chimps.\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/listapp/things-that-dont-mean-what-we-think-they-mean/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Things That Don't Mean What We Think They Mean"},{"content":" Decent WiFi\nThe wifi at this crap hole always works reliably.\nSpacious\nThere\u0026rsquo;s lots of room between tables and lots of nooks and crannies for semi-privacy.\nQuiet\nEverybody isn\u0026rsquo;t YELLING and the floors are carpeted and they use little proximity dealios so they don\u0026rsquo;t have to yell names.\nNot crowded\nProbably because the food is largely inedible its not super-jam-packed with people so I don\u0026rsquo;t feel bad sitting here for a couple hours.\nThey put calorie counts on the menu and nutrition info is readily available.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t really expect every place to do this but a few healthy lunch options with quiet atmosphere would be nice.\nWalking distance (ish) from the library.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s actually a mile and a half away but it\u0026rsquo;s a breezy cloudy 98 degrees today so it wasn\u0026rsquo;t too hot to walk.\n[You\u0026rsquo;ll notice the food was not on this list.

They weren\u0026rsquo;t always this way and won\u0026rsquo;t always be. I imagine this messed with our understanding of the universe for a hundred thousand years or so.\nThe 18th century Titius-Bode law stated that planets tend to orbit twice as far away as the next planet in. This was roughly true for Mercury through Saturn (the then-known planets) and correctly predicted the existence of the large asteroid Ceres and of Uranus, both discovered after the law was proposed.\nBut it fell apart with Neptune and Pluto and is in fact just a funny coincidence.\nClyde Tombaugh, discoverer of Pluto, was searching that area of the sky expecting to find a planet because observations of Neptune\u0026rsquo;s orbit suggested there was something big there.\nThe math was based on totally incorrect data. But there happened to be a planet there anyway. A very tiny planet far smaller than predicted. But we didn\u0026rsquo;t figure that out for years.\nAt precisely the time we were technically capable of building effective space probes, the four outer planets lined up for us.\nThis alignment made Voyager 2\u0026rsquo;s so called Grand Tour possible and exploded our understanding of the solar system.

The central peak is 3-5 miles high making it taller than Everest base to peak despite being on a very tiny moon. It is so large whatever caused it came close to blowing Mimas apart.

Roman is a scissors/comb/fingers guy, slower and calmer. Ibragim uses a comb and a straight razor. And Boris uses an electric razor with guard and finishes with a funny scissors/comb/scissors maneuver Boris also never uses water.\nThey clean up the edges with a straight razor and hot shaving cream.\nIt all feels so precise and perfected when they tidy up your sideburns, around the ears, and the back of the neck with a straight razor.

The probe just went radio silent so it can focus all its energies on capturing data during the encounter, which happens tomorrow.\nSomewhere around thirty years ago I sat in my bedroom reading a book with one picture-rich chapter for each of the 9 then-planets. When I got to the last chapter, on Pluto, the only real picture was a tiny gray smudge. The book made due with \u0026ldquo;artists renditions\u0026rdquo; to fill out the remaining pages. It was such a striking contrast to the other eight planets with their bright beautiful full-page Voyager pictures. It intrigued me to realize there was this whole world on the edge of our solar system about which we knew next to nothing.\nI remember very distinctly thinking, with a little pride, that someday we would fix that. Voyager 2 was fresh on my mind. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t long before that I watched the Neptune encounter on television. We were a curious and intelligent people and we would go to Pluto some day. I felt a little thrill of curiosity and exploration. Naively I never imagined it would take so long.\nFor years I would occasionally see what the pluto state of the art looked like. When the internet rolled around, I could google pluto pictures easily. But our view evolved very very slowly. I remember when two new moons were added. I remember when we first teased out surface features using Hubble and some serious image processing. And I especially remember my excitement when New Horizons launched almost 10 years ago. It seemed like the fulfillment of a life-long dream, and also like an impossibly long wait. Ten years!\nTomorrow New Horizons arrives at Pluto for a very brief flyby. The encounter lasts only a few hours because we\u0026rsquo;re moving so fast. But we\u0026rsquo;ll collect so much data in that time that it\u0026rsquo;ll be months before we have it all downloaded and years before we make sense of it all. That said, tomorrow when the first images arrive, we\u0026rsquo;ll get a high resolution crystal clear look at this world, which has been there for four billion years waiting patiently to be understood. It is something I have literally been looking forward to for thirty years. I can still picture that artists rendition from my book, and I\u0026rsquo;m so excited we\u0026rsquo;re about to replace it with the real deal.\nAre we there yet? Yes.

There\u0026rsquo;s another mural on the north side.\nDowntown #7: This wall in the Coronado neighborhood\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure what the building is but the wall has murals like this all along the block.\nDowntown #8: This oldie-but-goodie\nAnother that\u0026rsquo;s been there as long as I can remember. A mix of very skilled and very amateur with lots of idealistic aphorisms.\nDowntown #9: This dingy Mexican restaurant\nI\u0026rsquo;ve never eaten here but I kind of want to try it.\nDowntown #10: This rundown apartment building\nMexican muertos and a memorial to a fallen soldier.\nDowntown #11: This Phoenix with muscle cars\nNot sure what this place is. This is the back wall.\nDowntown #12: This dollar store\nIt really is a dollar store. Never been there but they also have a beautiful hand-lettered sign on the wall.\n❤️ Downtown #13: This nerdy troll\nAnother favorite.

I\u0026rsquo;m partial to the first in the series, Richard II but all four are fantastic. Very high quality and beautiful production. Weakest link: Falstaff, which is a shame because obviously he\u0026rsquo;s a big deal. He\u0026rsquo;s not bad. He\u0026rsquo;s just not great and this movie deserves a great Falstaff.\nHamlet directed by and starring Kenneth Branagh\nA contentious choice but for my money one of the best. It is beautifully set and wonderfully acted especially by Branagh himself as Hamlet, Derek Jacobi as Claudius and Julie Christie as Gertrude. Weakest link: Cheesy effects during the ghost scenes. Happiest surprise: Charlton Heston\u0026rsquo;s Player King and his transcendent recitation of the Priam Death scene.\nRomeo + Juliet directed by Baz Luhrman\nThe most effective modernization on the list. I think this movie is a near-perfect adaptation. It is atmospherically beautiful and well-acted all around. Standout performance: Harold Perrineau as Mercutio (who is also a standout character in the play). Favorite scene: the fish tank leading up to \u0026ldquo;palm to palm is palmer\u0026rsquo;s holy kiss.\u0026rdquo; Ahhh, so beautiful.\nTwelfth Night directed by Trevor Nunn\nI love this play and this movie is wonderful. A little unsteady in parts but it has it all where it counts. Wonderful performances by Helena Bonham Carter and Imogen Stubbs. Happiest surprise: Ben Kingsley as Feste.\nMuch Ado About Nothing directed by Joss Whedon\nThe story behind making this movie is as delightful as the film itself. Despite casual pronunciation and a modern setting it totally works, and Whedon fans will love seeing his favorite actors all around. Standout moments include Alexis Denishoff\u0026rsquo;s physical comedy as Benedick, and a subtle but hilarious acknowledgment of one of Shakespeare\u0026rsquo;s racist moments. Weakest link: Hero, but she\u0026rsquo;s a weak character in the play anyway so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t hurt much.\nMuch Ado About Nothing directed by Kenneth Branagh\nA much more traditional take on the play than Whedon\u0026rsquo;s version, and equally good. Emma Thompson\u0026rsquo;s Beatrice is one of my favorite Shakespeare performances, and the movie has several memorable scenes. Weakest link: Michael Keaton whose performance is too over the top even for the over the top Dogberry.\nHamlet starring Mel Gibson\nBy 1990 Zeffirelli seems to have lost his penchant for overacting. This version of Hamlet is quite good. It would probably be higher on my list if I didn\u0026rsquo;t have Branagh\u0026rsquo;s to compare. Standout performance: Helena Bonham Carter as a better Ophelia than Kate Winslet and Glenn Close as a wonderfully wicked Gertrude.\nCoriolanus starring Ralph Fiennes\nNot Shakespeare\u0026rsquo;s strongest play but a worthy one, and this modern film adaptation is wonderful. Standout performances: Ralph Fiennes as Coriolanus and Vanessa Redgrave as his terrifying mother.\nJulius Caesar starring Marlon Brando\nThe only thing wrong with this film is the less-technically-capable era it comes from. Brando is perfect, as is James Mason as Brutus. Weakest link: Female characters who all look like they were yanked from a \u0026rsquo;50s sitcom and dropped in Ancient Rome. Funniest moment: When Brutus\u0026rsquo; prop sword falls apart while he brandishes it and he just powers ahead like it\u0026rsquo;s a stage production or something. I guess film was expensive back then.\nA Midsummer Night\u0026rsquo;s Dream (1935)\nIt\u0026rsquo;s hard to look past 1935 production values but this is probably my favorite version of this play. The acting is solid, it is true to the source, and it is fascinating as a piece of film history. Standout performance: A very young (child) Mickey Rooney as the Puck.\nA Midsummer Night\u0026rsquo;s Dream BBC version\nThis is a filmed live stage production which always undermines the feel a bit, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t bad. Some great performances and some at least interesting whimsical settings. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to make this beautiful play unenjoyable.\nMacbeth directed by Roman Polanski\nThis is a decent version as far as 1970s versions go. The effects are obviously below today\u0026rsquo;s standards but it isn\u0026rsquo;t distracting. Performances are all quite good although I find Francesca Annis\u0026rsquo; Lady Macbeth too sweet and delicate. Weakest link: Polanski\u0026rsquo;s weird obsession with excessive nudity and the unfortunate decision to render Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s dagger hallucinations on screen.\nRomeo and Juliet directed by Zeffirelli\nThis film suffers from the same bizarre exaggerated movements and terribly choreographed fight scenes that seem to infect all Zeffirelli\u0026rsquo;s Shakespeare adaptations. These plus the lousy old school costumes and sets make it hard for me to take it seriously. Romeo is also poorly acted. But Juliet (ignoring the possible child pornography) is wonderful. Perhaps the best onscreen Juliet of all.\nThe Merchant of Venice starring Al Pacino and Jeremy Irons\nHarold Bloom astutely calls this play unplayable to a modern audience. If you make Shylock a monster (as he was probably intended) it is antisemitic. And if you make him sympathetic then the play celebrates cruelty. This movie takes the latter approach with the expected result. That said, the acting is wonderful all around and the production is gorgeous. It is like two hours of beautiful cinema that leaves you empty in the end.\nA Midsummer Night\u0026rsquo;s Dream starring Kevin Kline and Calista Flockheart\nI don\u0026rsquo;t love this movie as much as critics seem to. It is worth watching, but for some reason to me it lacks the emotional punch that the play should have. Kevin Kline makes a great Bottom though, and Calista Flockheart is wonderful as well. Weakest link: plays loose with the source material in places.\nTitus starring Anthony Hopkins (Titus Andronicus)\nI\u0026rsquo;ll let the academics decide if this play is worthy of interest. But this movie does as much as can be done with the source material. The adaptation is bizarre in places but in a good way. Standout performance: Jessica Lange as Tamora. Weakest link: It is hard to find. There\u0026rsquo;s a terrible version on YouTube. Otherwise look for a DVD.\nTaming of the Shrew directed by Zeffirelli\nI don\u0026rsquo;t love this movie. It feels over acted. The costumes are weird. Elizabeth Taylor screeches and never convinces me of her intelligence or her apparent suppressed love for Petruchio. Richard Burton is better but not great.\nRomeo \u0026amp; Juliet starring Hailee Steinfeld\nI\u0026rsquo;m probably bitter because I wish we\u0026rsquo;d put this budget into a great Antony and Cleopatra but the world did not need yet another Romeo and Juliet. You could have said the same thing in 1996 but Baz Luhrmann\u0026rsquo;s was innovative. This movie on the other hand is an unoriginal rehash with new faces. I was excited about Steinfeld because she was so amazing in True Grit but she speaks Shakespeare like she\u0026rsquo;s leaving a voicemail. And nobody else was much better.\nAntony and Cleopatra directed by Charlton Heston\nIt is a tragedy of modern film that this play, which to me is arguably Shakespeare\u0026rsquo;s greatest work, has no decent film version. This is the only movie on this list that I\u0026rsquo;ll say this about: it is unwatchably terrible. The central conceit of the story is the overwhelming attraction between the two lovers and Heston and Neil have negative chemistry. If I had Bill Gates money I would pay whatever it takes for a quality film of this play.\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/listapp/shakespeare-movies-ranked/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Shakespeare Movies Ranked"},{"content":" The handsome couple on the Vovomeena.

Please note: there\u0026rsquo;s no judgement here. I\u0026rsquo;m not suggesting these things are unworthy of time. I have great respect for our culture. I just don\u0026rsquo;t understand it sometimes or don\u0026rsquo;t feel a compulsion to engage. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure why.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve only watched one television show for its entire run in my life.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve watched bits and pieces of lots of shows of course, but never had a show I really watched except Buffy.

Here\u0026rsquo;s my diary of the aftermath in this lonely post-marriage outpost. I hope there\u0026rsquo;s somebody left to read this.\nDay 1: The beginning of the end\nSurprisingly my marriage is still intact. But my wife is traveling with spotty cell service so it is possible she hasn\u0026rsquo;t been able to get through to me to call it off.\nDay 2: Churching\nWent to church today. Bishop reminded us that people supporting gay marriage are ok. Drove to the hospital to visit a guy with a toe problem and the guy I went with said it was a shame about the gays. But he\u0026rsquo;s kind of an idiot so I just let it go. All the married people seem to still be married.\nDay 3: Back to work\nWent to work today. I work for Apple which is like the biggest gay company in the world. The CEO is gay. Like 40% of my coworkers are gay. Their logo even used to be a gay rainbow back before it was cool. So it will come as no surprise that the apocalyptic influence of gay marriage has had no discernible negative impact on my job.\nDay 4: Cracks in the fabric of society are beginning to appear\nFound out from a neighbor today that the other neighbors are getting a divorce. IT IS UPON US. Actually they were apparently planning this months ago but I\u0026rsquo;m sure that was caused by gay marriage premonitions or something. I\u0026rsquo;m very scared.\nDay 5: Together again\nNever mind. I was wrong about my neighbors. They\u0026rsquo;re not getting a divorce. They\u0026rsquo;re just moving. We live in a pretty gay neighborhood though so it might be related. Side note: Never trust Phil for news. I think he might be one of them. Stupid Phil.\nDay 6: Reunited and it feels so doomed\nMy wife got home from her trip today. Looks like so far we\u0026rsquo;re still married, but I can feel the sanctity being sucked out of our relationship as I write this.\nDay 7: Nothing to report\nI\u0026rsquo;m beginning to think the institution of marriage might survive this. It may just be Friday talking though.

And I especially love words that came to us in interesting ways. Here are some of my favorites.\nBedlam\nBedlam, meaning a scene of uproar and confusion, comes from the 14th century British insane asylum called Bedlam Hospital, a colloquial pronunciation of Bethlehem Hospital, a place notorious for chaos and poverty.\nOdyssey\nYou would be forgiven for thinking that The Odyssey is called The Odyssey because it is a story about a great odyssey. But you\u0026rsquo;d be wrong. It\u0026rsquo;s called that because it is the story of Odysseus, and has had that name since long before English existed. The English word \u0026ldquo;odyssey\u0026rdquo; comes from the title of this epic poem, not the other way around.\nMentor\nSpeaking of The Odyssey, remember how Telemachus was helped along the way by his pal Mentor? That\u0026rsquo;s not a translation either. The guy\u0026rsquo;s name, in Greek, was Mentōr. Our word comes from a fictional character. If you are someone\u0026rsquo;s mentor you are figuratively acting as Mentōr to their Telemachus.\nCheck, as in \u0026ldquo;Check yourself\u0026rdquo;\nI always assumed when you put your opponent in \u0026ldquo;check\u0026rdquo; in chess, it was called that because \u0026ldquo;check\u0026rdquo; means to stop or slow the progress of something. Turns out that\u0026rsquo;s backwards. We get that meaning of check from the game of chess, which existed, check and all, before the English language.\nViolin and Viola\nThe dictionary defines \u0026ldquo;Viola\u0026rdquo; as \u0026ldquo;an instrument in the violin family, larger.\u0026rdquo; And the derivation of \u0026ldquo;violin\u0026rdquo; is \u0026ldquo;diminutive of viola.\u0026rdquo; I love this weirdness.\nArugula / Rocket\nIn America we call this spicy green \u0026ldquo;arugula\u0026rdquo;. In England it is called \u0026ldquo;rocket\u0026rdquo;. No, this isn\u0026rsquo;t because Americans like to do their own thing. The plant is ancient and comes from Italy originally. In Latin it was \u0026ldquo;Eruca\u0026rdquo;. This became \u0026ldquo;Roquette\u0026rdquo; in French. England gets the name rocket from the French. There was no transporting of fresh greens across the Atlantic back then. America discovered this green in the late 1800s by way of Italian immigrants who called it arugula.\nPanic\nFrom the Greek Panikon meaning \u0026ldquo;of Pan\u0026rdquo;; Pan being the satyr God of the wild. Perhaps from the sense of fear we feel in the wild when we hear animal noises and become panicked. I love thinking of a phrase like \u0026ldquo;panic attack\u0026rdquo; as having the same grammatical form as \u0026ldquo;scientific journal\u0026rdquo;: An attack of the great god Pan (who apparently is not dead).\nMuseum\nFrom the Greek mouseion meaning a shrine to the muses (like pantheon is a shrine to all gods). A generic word today, it was originally \u0026ldquo;the\u0026rdquo; museum, a library built to honor the muses, inspirers of art, music, and poetry.\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/listapp/english-words-with-interesting-backstories/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"English Words With Interesting Backstories➕"},{"content":"The perks and perils of growing your music library from 6,000 to 30,000,000 songs.\nHey Siri play the song You Can\u0026rsquo;t Hold Back Spring\n…what is this crap?!\nHey Siri play the Tom Waits song You Can\u0026rsquo;t Hold Back Spring\n…wait what?\nHey Siri play the song You Can\u0026rsquo;t Hold Back Spring by Tom Waits\n…ahhh, that\u0026rsquo;s the stuff.\nHey Siri play the song Mexican Home by John Prine\n…oh my word no not the twangy one.\nHey Siri play Mexican Home Live by John Prine\n\u0026hellip;ahhh that\u0026rsquo;s the stuff.\nHey Siri play the song Remember When by…um…Robert?

We\u0026rsquo;ve been married almost 21 years and I see no reason to change. Here\u0026rsquo;re a few of the things I love about her.\nShe loved me at 17-18 when I was lost and confused and didn\u0026rsquo;t love myself.\nIt was the hardest time of my life and she made it bearable. Even beautiful at times.\nShe likes to not talk for a few minutes after an affecting movie and just let it settle in.\nThose silent moments side by side are golden.\nShe is such a clever mom she makes it look effortless.\nIt is always after the fact that I realize she had been executing a complex year long plan to build independence and confidence and suddenly my 17 year old is comfortable booking a flight, flying alone, catching the shuttle, staying in a hotel alone, and finding her way to the college tour. And then I say, \u0026ldquo;Oh is this why you did that whole public transit scavenger hunt for her 16th birthday?!\u0026rdquo; And she smiles knowingly and pats my arm.\nShe\u0026rsquo;s super-creative.\nShe makes pillow cases for everyone, she made a quilt for our bed, she documents our lives in elaborate scrapbooks that boggle my mind, she makes baby books for friend\u0026rsquo;s babies, she turns glass jars into beautiful center pieces for the school \u0026ldquo;senior night\u0026rdquo;, she makes a skirt out of neckties, she alters clothes, SHE MADE THESE DRESSES\u0026hellip;\nShe is passionate about helping people.\nAs a stay at home mom she volunteered constantly. Girl Scouts, school gardening and art programs, making meals for home bound people, driving seniors to the doctor… When she went back to work it was right into serving the least-fortunate people in our community. Right now she\u0026rsquo;s in Indiana helping a friend road trip her three small kids to a family reunion in Michigan because the friend\u0026rsquo;s husband died suddenly last fall and the mom wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure she could handle it herself. That\u0026rsquo;s how she is.\nShe loves road trips.\nI do not love road trips. But that\u0026rsquo;s ok. She and my girls took a huge multi-week road trip every summer for years and I would join them somewhere for a week or two. She took them all over the country, and in to Canada and Mexico a little bit. So many moms say \u0026ldquo;aren\u0026rsquo;t you nervous to travel with the kids by yourself\u0026rdquo;. She is gracious in reply and I chuckle. My wife nervous? LOL.\nShe has managed to keep a close open relationship with our 17 year old girl.\nEverything I\u0026rsquo;ve read says this is a miracle. Isabel talks to her mom about absolutely everything. When the topic is particularly sensitive or potentially embarrassing they talk via texting instead and my wife\u0026rsquo;s a-ok with that. They aren\u0026rsquo;t always happy with each other but they are amazingly close.\nShe\u0026rsquo;s ridiculously organized and effective when it\u0026rsquo;s time to get it done.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re doing a few minor fixups to our house getting ready to sell. I was prepared to put too much money into it because who had the time to figure it all out? But her internship ended and she came home and poof it is almost done, twice as nice as I had hoped, and cost less than half what I was expecting. Because she\u0026rsquo;s meticulous and organized.\nMost of her friends are old ladies.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know why I love this but I do. Her best friend is Janet, 71. She\u0026rsquo;s got oodles of close friends in their sixties and seventies. She says they are kinder to and more supportive of each other and don\u0026rsquo;t talk about babies and periods all the time.\nLOOK HOW CUTE SHE IS\nWith her funny hat.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/listapp/my-future-wife/","tags":["Archive Post","Photos"],"title":"My Future Wife"},{"content":" \u0026ldquo;You are not my mother.

It is so fitting that the words they share in this final moment are not ours to hear, and would not mean anything to us if we did hear them.\nWhen John Grady Cole shares his lunch with schoolchildren near the end of All the Pretty Horses\nThis is one of my favorite moments in literature. To have John Grady retell the story we\u0026rsquo;ve just witnessed to children, to hear their genuine concern and their childish faith in resolution, indulges the reader\u0026rsquo;s need to pause and reflect on all that has happened, and especially to pretend to believe in happy endings before the final chapters confirm what we already know. This is just a tiny excerpt of the whole beautiful passage.\nWhen Juliet takes control in Romeo and Juliet\nJuliet begins the play a set piece until everyone in her life fails her utterly. In Act III she comes to her own as a character and as a woman. This is the moment she realizes nobody is going to rescue her, the power structures that surround her are corrupt, and she can be her own hero. Later when all is lost (allegorically), she ends her new life on her own terms with unwavering courage. She is the one true heroic character in this play.\nWhen Cleopatra eulogizes Antony in Antony and Cleopatra\nCleopatra\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;I dreamt there was an emperor Antony\u0026rdquo; speech is one of my favorite passages in Shakespeare. Perhaps she is delusional but I choose to believe Cleopatra knows what we all should come to know: that the imprint we leave on those we love, and the goodness they found hidden within us far exceeds any fiction; that the real fact and truth of a life is the goodness and not the failings. Antony failed as a man but not as her man, and that condemns all shadows.\nWhen Kurt Vonnegut reminds us how powerless we really are in Slaughterhouse Five\nIt is the passage most emblematic of Vonnegut’s sardonic wit, and it is a humbling reminder that life will bring us what it will.\nWhen William Stoner finds a perfect peace in Stoner\nI love this book and I especially love the zen acceptance of this passage. The contrasting imagery, the feeble light, the cool nighttime. And Stoner\u0026rsquo;s ability to find peace within it all.\nRabindranath Tagore on the Crystal Palace of Truth in Once There Was a King\nI love this aside in the opening of this story where Tagore reminds us what matters in storytelling and refuses to apologize for the unrealistic fairytale we\u0026rsquo;re about to read.\nWhen Etgar Keerat finds humanity everywhere in One Step Beyond\nI\u0026rsquo;ve never read anything by Keerat that wasn\u0026rsquo;t great. His short stories are full of compassion, wit, and genuine originality. This passage is brave and heartfelt, and put in the mouth of a convicted killer.\nThe Sex Scene in The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\nThis is my favorite sex scene, not because it is arousing (it isn’t) or graphic (it isn’t) but because it so powerfully conveys the total emotional dissociation of two young people unprepared to comprehend their act.\nWhen Dr. Dorian counsels Mrs. Arable in Charlotte\u0026rsquo;s Web\nI love Charlotte’s Web (which I’ve read way too many times to admit) and I especially love the chapter called \u0026ldquo;Dr. Dorian\u0026rdquo;. Mrs. Arable is concerned that Fern is spending too much time with animals and his response is a perfect analysis of what it means to be a healthy curious child — a privilege that only lasts such a short time. The whole chapter is great. This is just a taste.\nThe beginning of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind the second time through\nThe beginning is engrossing the first time through and powerfully moving the second time through. I can\u0026rsquo;t watch it enough.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/listapp/perfect-fictional-moments/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Perfect Fictional Moments"},{"content":" The dishwasher\nThe washing machine\nThe ceiling fan in the master bedroom\nThe AC intake in the family room\nCrickets\nNot my daughters who are both out of town.

If your perception of America\u0026rsquo;s gun violence problem is centered on the notion of \u0026ldquo;a few\u0026rdquo; mass shootings, then please consider that for every mass shooting victim this year, there are THOUSANDS of individual gun-related deaths.\nThis sounds callous but from a statistical and policy standpoint, mass shootings are an insignificant distraction from the real issue. 75 people will die in America today from guns. Nine of them will dominate the news channels and Facebook walls. The other 66 will go unmentioned. Tomorrow 75 more will die, none of them in mass shootings.

Space probes have studied every planet in the solar system but we\u0026rsquo;ve never had a probe to Pluto. The New Horizons mission has its closest Pluto encounter on July 14. It will dramatically expand our understanding. Here\u0026rsquo;s how our view of Pluto has evolved.\n1930: The photograph from which Clyde Tombaugh discovered Pluto\nTombaugh found Pluto by comparing thousands of shots of little slices of the sky from different days to see if anything moved. The arrow here points to Pluto in the first confirmed image ever taken. Our view of Pluto was more or less the same—a tiny white dot—for the next 40 years.\n1978: The discovery of Pluto\u0026rsquo;s moon\nThis US Naval Observatory photo of Pluto was the first with enough detail to detect Pluto\u0026rsquo;s large moon Charon, seen here as a bulge on the top edge of the disk in the left picture.\n1988: The best ground-based view possible\nThis shot represents approximately the best image we\u0026rsquo;re technically capable of getting from a state of the art ground-based telescope. If we want better we need to move to space.\n1994: The Hubble Space Telescope captures Pluto\u0026rsquo;s disk clearly\nThis false color image was the best picture of Pluto in existence when I started college. It shows the well-resolved disk of Pluto and a fuzzy Charon.\n1996: The first hint of surface features, captured by Hubble\nThe images in the top-left corners are the actual shots. The larger images are heavily digitally processed to normalize shape and accentuate features. Until this month these were the clearest pictures of Pluto ever taken, and the first to show any surface features.\n2005: Hubble reveals two additional moons orbiting Pluto.\nNamed Nix and Hydra, they are far smaller than Pluto\u0026rsquo;s large moon Charon. To make them show up, the mighty Hubble had to overexpose the otherwise-dim Pluto which is why you see the \u0026ldquo;star\u0026rdquo; artifacts.\nMay 2015: New Horizons begins to improve our view\nThe New Horizons spacecraft was launched in 2006 on a high speed course to Pluto. It arrives in July but it\u0026rsquo;s close now and we\u0026rsquo;re starting to get pictures better than we can get from telescopes.\nJuly 2015: ???\nFor comparison, here is a picture of the comet 67P taken by the orbiting spacecraft Rosetta during its encounter last year. The inset picture is the same comet photographed by a ground-based telescope. Pluto won\u0026rsquo;t look anything like this but it shows how a space probe gives us a dramatically better view. Essentially every beautiful detailed picture of a planet you\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen was taken by a probe, not a telescope.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/listapp/85-years-of-pluto-our-evolving-view/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"85 Years of Pluto: Our Evolving View"},{"content":"What she lacks in skill she makes up for in vision.

Of course it is harder to be constructive than to complain so this list took a lot more thought than THINGS THAT ARE OVERRATED. But that\u0026rsquo;s good because it made me happier in the end.\nPeople\nHerman Melville put it best: \u0026ldquo;See how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them.\u0026rdquo; In the few cases where I\u0026rsquo;ve come to understand someone I judged harshly, I\u0026rsquo;ve always grown to love them. I have to assume this prevails. It may be related to the so-called fundamental attribution error: our tendency to ascribe bad behavior to character in others and to circumstance in ourselves. Whatever the cause the implication is clear: People are better than we give them credit.\nThe American Education System\nDepending on how you measure, our schools are ranked 15th or 35th internationally behind basically every wealthy country. People talk about fixing this with better teachers, bigger tests, more accountability, new standards, hot technology… The thing is, \u0026ldquo;When you measure…American schools with poverty rates less than 20% our kids…out perform every nation in the world\u0026rdquo; (Link.) We have great schools. But we have a terrible poverty problem, which is something you can\u0026rsquo;t teach around.\nThe New Horizons Pluto Flyby Mission\nI was a huge astronomy nut when I was a kid. I checked out books on astronomy from our tiny small-town library every chance I got. At the time Pluto was shrouded in mystery. The books didn\u0026rsquo;t even have a picture better than a fuzzy smear. I remember thinking that some day we would fix that. 10 years ago New Horizons launched and I was thrilled. And now finally the day is almost here: a day I\u0026rsquo;ve been waiting for literally for 30 years. In 45 days the Pluto encounter begins.\nThe Movie Brave\nThis is one of Pixar\u0026rsquo;s least critically successful movies with a rotten tomatoes rating of 76% and lots of bad reviews, which is sad because it\u0026rsquo;s a princess story with no love interest and a mother/daughter \u0026ldquo;psychodrama\u0026rdquo; that values mother/daughter relationships as the complex, important, salvageable things they are. I sometimes think viewers didn\u0026rsquo;t know what to do with a princess who doesn\u0026rsquo;t fall in love. Also, my Sophie says Merida is \u0026ldquo;her\u0026rdquo; princess because she\u0026rsquo;s strong-willed and wild.\nThe King James Bible\nJust like with iPhone and Android, the King James Bible is a pretty neat thing that\u0026rsquo;s ruined by its most die-hard fans. The translation is contemporary to Shakespeare and it\u0026rsquo;s intimacy provides a fascinating contrast to his high-minded style. It is full of beauty poetic (John 1:1-5), didactic (1 Corinthian 13), and philosophic (Ecclesiastes 1:7-11).\nPhoenix\nA lot of people think Arizona is full of homophobic right-wing cowboys with concealed handguns. And we deserve that a little bit with our run of bad lawmakers. But this is also a culturally diverse city with a booming local business scene and signs of a renaissance. I live uptown and I love the murals, local restaurants, farmers markets, Latino-American culture, bike shares, rehabs, smile-inducing pride parade, desert flora, hipster biker gangs, mountains, and three seasons of gorgeous weather.\nFacebook\nThis is the social site people love to hate. Sure, Zuckerberg is (was?) a slime ball, and there have been some privacy concerns. But 1) from a technical perspective it is an exceptionally well designed site, always fast and reliable despite astronomical load, and 2) functionally it is the place I stay in touch with family and friends spread all around the world. I am more connected to my sisters, their kids, and my extended family than ever before Facebook.

But here\u0026rsquo;s a list of the more obvious ones. For the middle school crowd + me.\nWhen she was jealous of a horse.\nAct 1, Scene 5: \u0026ldquo;Where think\u0026rsquo;st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he Or does he walk? or is he on his horse? O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!\u0026rdquo; — \u0026ldquo;bear the weight of Antony\u0026rdquo; indeed.\nWhen she teased a eunuch about being unable to give her any pleasure.\nAct 1, Scene 5: \u0026ldquo;I take no pleasure In aught an eunuch has.\u0026rdquo; — Antony was out of town and Cleopatra was so bored.\nWhen she got a little heated when a messenger arrived sent by Antony.\nAct 2, Scene 5: \u0026ldquo;Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears, That long time have been barren.\u0026rdquo; — This is my favorite of all. It\u0026rsquo;s so explicit and ridiculous. The footnotes of the New Cambridge edition tell me this \u0026ldquo;calls to mind the Roman empress who is supposed to have lamented the fact that the female anatomy has only seven orifices.\u0026rdquo; Huh…\nWhen she remembered how big and manly Antony is.\nAct 4, Scene 15: \u0026ldquo;Here\u0026rsquo;s sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord! \u0026hellip; Yet come a little,— nWishes were ever fools,—O, come, come, come; And welcome, welcome! die where thou hast lived.\u0026rdquo; — She\u0026rsquo;s only helping an injured Antony climb into her monument here, but In Elizabethan English to \u0026ldquo;die\u0026rdquo; was a common euphemism for orgasm. And I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure \u0026ldquo;come, come, come\u0026rdquo; was exactly what it is today.\nWhen she made a little joke about snakes.\nAct 5, Scene 2: \u0026ldquo;Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there, That kills and pains not?\u0026rdquo; — There\u0026rsquo;s that die = orgasm thing again. But really she\u0026rsquo;s just talking about getting bit by a snake. Honest.\nBonus: When she made Agrippa joke like a schoolboy.\nAct 2, Scene 2: \u0026ldquo;Royal wench! She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed; He plowed her, and she cropped.\u0026rdquo; — This wasn\u0026rsquo;t said by Cleopatra, rather about her.

It does mean, however, that I must say goodbye to Six Fried Rice.\nI want to give my sincerest thanks to Jesse Antunes, who has been the most ideal business partner imaginable. His strengths have augmented my weaknesses perfectly. He has been honest, dedicated, supportive, patient — I don’t think we’ve ever had a serious disagreement in eight years running a business together. And most importantly he is a good man, full of care for the people he loves. It has made a difference. Thank you.\nI also want to thank all my customers for trusting us with your important work, and giving us the opportunity to do fun things and get paid for it. We have been blessed with exceptional, challenging, reliable clients and I consider many of you to be friends. Of all we’ve done in the last eight years, the thing I’m most proud of is the longevity of our client relationships. We’ve been working with a few of you since the very beginning, and many of you for more than five years. Thank you.\nAnd finally to all of you in the FileMaker community who supported us in the early days and have continued to do so: Thank you. It was a good run and Jesse and I both felt so much support from our FileMaker friends right out of the gate.\nJesse will continue to operate Six Fried Rice and our staff will remain intact. I will simply bow out, a little sad, but mostly excited.\nThe earth, that's nature's mother, is her tomb.\nWhat is her burying grave, that is her womb.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/fb/photo-post-218/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":""},{"content":"Maybe.

(Actually the whole thing is beautifully argued, but the conclusion is particularly sincere.)\n(Source: Link)\nCONCLUSION:\nI am aware that a large number of Oregonians, perhaps even a majority, have religious or moral objections to expanding the definition of civil marriage (and thereby expanding the benefits and rights that accompany marriage) to gay and lesbian families. It was\u0026rsquo; these same objections that led to the passage of Measure 36 in 2004. Generations of Americans, my own included, were raised in a world in which homosexuality was believed to be a moral perversion, a mental disorder, or a mortal sin. I remember that one of the more popular playground games of my childhood was called \u0026ldquo;smear the queer\u0026rdquo; and it was played with great zeal and without a moment\u0026rsquo;s thought to today\u0026rsquo;s political correctness. On a darker level, that same worldview led to an environment of cruelty, violence, and self-loathing. It was but 1986 when the United States Supreme Court justified, on the basis of a \u0026ldquo;millennia of moral teaching,\u0026rdquo; the imprisonment of gay men and lesbian women who engaged in consensual sexual acts. (Bowers, 478 U.S. at 197 (Burger, C.J., concurring), overruled by Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 578.) Even today I am reminded of the legacy that we have bequeathed today\u0026rsquo;s generation when my son looks dismissively at the sweater I bought him for Christmas and, with a roll of his eyes, says \u0026ldquo;dad…that is so gay.\u0026rdquo;\nIt is not surprising then that many of us raised with such a world view would wish to protect our beliefs and our families by turning to the ballot box to enshrine in law those traditions we have come to value. But just as the Constitution protects the expression of these moral viewpoints, it equally protects the minority from being diminished by them.\nIt is at times difficult to see past the shrillness of the debate. Accusations of religious bigotry and banners reading \u0026ldquo;God Hates Fags\u0026rdquo; make for a messy democracy and, at times, test the First Amendment resolve of both sides. At the core of the Equal Protection Clause, however, there exists a foundational belief that certain rights should be shielded from the barking crowds; that certain rights are subject to ownership by all and not the stake hold of popular trend or shifting majorities.\nMy decision will not be the final word on this subject, but on this issue of marriage I am struck more by our similarities than our differences. I believe that if we can look for a moment past gender and sexuality, we can see in these plaintiffs nothing more or less than our own families. Families who we would expect our Constitution to protect, if not exalt, in equal measure. With discernment we see not shadows lurking in closets or the stereotypes of what was once believed; rather, we see families committed to the common purpose of love, devotion, and service to the greater community.\nWhere will this all lead? I know that many suggest we are going down a slippery slope that will have no moral boundaries. To those who truly harbor such fears, I can only say this: Let us look less to the sky to see what might fall; rather, let us look to each other…and rise.\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/fb/the-conclusion-of-judge-mcshanes-opinion-overruling-oregons-same/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":""},{"content":"Hanging out with Isabel.

Do men on that policy get actual payments for prenatal? Of course not. Is the insurance company smart enough to figure out that they\u0026rsquo;ll never pay for prenatal for men? Of course. Do their actuarial calculations take this into account? Obviously. So are you paying for services you don\u0026rsquo;t need? No. Do we all bear the cost of important health care for everyone in our group? Yes. That\u0026rsquo;s the whole point.\nEnd of rant.\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/fb/for-about-the-10th-time-i-just-heard-someone/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":""},{"content":"My beautiful Isabel on their way to the homecoming dance.

Any IP attorneys care to chime in?\nSometime between 1860-ish and 1908, Samuel Chamberlain wrote his personal memoirs which he titled My Confession. As far as I can tell he never published it. The longhand manuscript passed through various hands until it was \u0026ldquo;discovered\u0026rdquo; in the 1950s and purchased by Time, inc. Time edited and published the book along with its original artwork, then sold the original (and historically significant) manuscript to the United States Military Academy. The Time published book is now out of print (and has been for 50 years). Texas A\u0026amp;M University Press published a revised copy with a new introduction in 1996.\nNow here\u0026rsquo;s the question. Both of these carry a copyright. The Time edition says \u0026ldquo;Copyright 1956 Time Inc.

Unfortunately, the normal (non-64-bit) ZIP file format can\u0026rsquo;t handle input files over 4GB (even if the output ZIP file is much smaller).\nThe Problem My cron jobs began failing when one of my databases grew over 4GB, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t notice because ZIP files were still being created on schedule. Alas they were truncated files that couldn\u0026rsquo;t actually be unzipped.\nThe unzip command line tool reports:\narchive: {my file} tags: - Archive Post End-of-central-directory signature not found. Either this file is not a zipfile, or it constitutes one disk of a multi-part archive. In the latter case the central directory and zip file comment will be found on the last disk(s) of this archive. unzip: cannot find zipfile directory in one of {my file} or {my file}.zip, and cannot find {my_file}.ZIP, period. The unzip -F and unzip -FF fix operations both failed to do anything with the file. (I think they just toss out bad files within the zip. Since this zip contained only one huge file, they were no help.) Blast.\nSometimes the Mac OS X Archive Utility app (the thing that runs out of the box when you double-click a ZIP file in the Finder) does a better job with messed up ZIP files than the command line tool, so I gave it a try. After working for maybe 30 seconds (on Mac OS X Lion), it reported:\nUnable to expand \u0026#34;{my file}\u0026#34; into \u0026#34;{my folder}\u0026#34;. (Error 2 - No such file or directory.) Oddly, on Mac OS X Snow Leopard, the message was slightly different::\nUnable to expand \u0026#34;{my file}\u0026#34; into \u0026#34;{my folder}\u0026#34;. (Error 1 - Operation not permitted.) The Solution The thing is, even though my file was truncated, I knew enough about ZIP to know some of my data was in there. Since my database dump file was about 4.00001 GB of plain text, I was actually pretty sure most of my data was in there in a usable form. Alas, a little googling didn\u0026rsquo;t turn up any tools for Mac OS X that claimed to be able to extract partial data from a bum ZIP file.\nBut the fact that the Archive Utiltiy spent so much time before failing made me reasonably confident that it was actually unzipping most of my data before giving up. It must be storing that temporary data somewhere…\nAfter a little digging (some guessing based on what I know about Mac OS X plus a few repeated runs and some monitoring with ls and grep) I zeroed in on its temporary file, which lives in a Cleanup At Startup folder somewhere in /var/folders. This temp file grows gradually while the unzip operation is in progress, and then disappears before the error dialog box is displayed.\nOn my computer this folder is here:\n/var/folders/fc/fwtmk8jn7fs4pb3hvb_p78j40000gn/T/Cleanup At Startup But I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure all that junk is semi-random and you sometimes have more than one, so you\u0026rsquo;ll have to dig for yours. It is somewhere under /var/folders, and this command should turn it up:\nsudo find /var/folders -name \u0026#39;Cleanup At Startup\u0026#39; Your goal is simply to copy the temp file to a new location after it is mostly written, but before Archive Utility deletes it. To buy yourself some time, you can suspend the Archive Utility process before it deletes the temp file. Just start the unzip, then find its pid with:\nps ax | grep Archive And then, right before it is finished, suspend it with:\nkill -STOP {pid} Then, while it is suspended, find its temp file and copy it somewhere else. The temp file will be big (nearly 4GB) with a very recent timestamp, somewhere in one of those Cleanup At Startup folders.\n(After you\u0026rsquo;ve started the file copying, you can just force-quite Archive Utility. If you really want to resume it so it can fail on its own, use kill -START {pid})\nAfter this hackery, I had a nearly-complete database dump file that I could restore, then patch up.\nNote: Note: This process won\u0026rsquo;t work if the file inside your ZIP isn\u0026rsquo;t truncatable. For instance, my file was plain text, so in the worst case, it was just cut off a bit before the end. If this had been a word file, or a JPEG, or something else, the extracted data would most likely fail to open.

All emphasis is my own. [ed: The link did indeed stop working sometime since this was posted.]\nJony Ive\u0026rsquo;s Eulogy to Steve Jobs at Apple\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Celebrating Steve\u0026rdquo; Event October 19, 2011 Steve used to say to me (and he used to say this a lot), \u0026ldquo;Hey Jony, here\u0026rsquo;s a dopey idea.\u0026rdquo; And sometimes they were — really dopey. Sometimes they were truly dreadful. But sometimes they took the air from the room, and they left us both completely silent. Bold, crazy, magnificent ideas. Or quiet, simple ones which, in their subtlety, their detail, were utterly profound.\nAnd just as Steve loved ideas, and loved making stuff, he treated the process of creativity with a rare and a wonderful reverence. I think he, better than anyone, understood that while ideas ultimately can be so powerful, they begin as fragile, barely formed thoughts, so easily missed, so easily compromised, so easily just squished.\nI loved the way that he listened so intently. I loved his perception, his remarkable sensitivity, and his surgically precise opinion. I really believe there was a beauty in how singular, how keen his insight was, even though sometimes it could sting.\nAs I\u0026rsquo;m sure many of you know, Steve didn\u0026rsquo;t confine his sense of excellence to making products. When we travelled together, we would check in and I\u0026rsquo;d go up to my room. And I\u0026rsquo;d leave my bags very neatly by the door. And I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t unpack. And I would go and sit on the bed. I would go and sit on the bed next to the phone. And I would wait for the inevitable phone call: \u0026ldquo;Hey Jony, this hotel sucks. Let\u0026rsquo;s go.\u0026rdquo;\nHe used to joke that the lunatics had taken over the asylum, as we shared a giddy excitement spending months and months working on a part of a product that nobody would ever see. Not with their eyes. We did it because we really believed it was right because we cared. He believed that there was a gravity, almost a sense of civic responsibility, to care way beyond any sort of functional imperative.\nWhile the work hopefully appeared inevitable, appeared simple and easy, it really cost. It cost us all, didn\u0026rsquo;t it? But you know what? It cost him most. He cared the most. He worried the most deeply. He constantly questioned, \u0026ldquo;Is this good enough? Is this right?\u0026rdquo; And despite all his successes, all his achievements, he never assumed that we would get there in the end. When the ideas didn\u0026rsquo;t come, and when the prototypes failed, it was with great intent, with faith, that he decided to believe we would eventually make something great.\nBut the joy of getting there! I loved his enthusiasm, his simple delight (often, I think, mixed with some relief) that, yeah, we got there. We got there in the end and it was good. You can see his smile, can\u0026rsquo;t you? The celebration of making something great for everybody, enjoying the defeat of cynicism, the rejection of reason, the rejection of being told a hundred times, \u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t do that.\u0026rdquo; So his, I think, was a victory for beauty, for purity, and, as he would say, for giving a damn.\nHe was my closest and my most loyal friend. We worked together for nearly fifteen years. (And he still laughed at the way I say \u0026ldquo;aluminium\u0026rdquo;.)\nFor the past two weeks, we\u0026rsquo;ve all been struggling to find ways to say goodbye. This morning I simply want to end by saying, \u0026ldquo;Thank you, Steve.\u0026rdquo; Thank you for your remarkable vision, which has united and inspired this extraordinary group of people. For all that we have learned from you, and for all that we will continue to learn from each other: Thank you, Steve.\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/posterous/jony-ives-steve-jobs-eulogy/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Jony Ive's Steve Jobs Eulogy"},{"content":" Four haloween birdhouses.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/posterous/mamie-and-isabel-made-cute-little-haunted-birdhouses/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Mamie and Isabel Made Cute Little Haunted Birdhouses"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m not sure why I love this lyric so much, but I sure do.\nThis is not a parable\nThis is a terrible…\nThis is a terrible thing\nYes I will rhyme that after…\nAfter all I've done today\nI have earned my wings\nIt Happened Today, by R.E.M, released 2010 ","img":false,"link":"/archive/posterous/this-is-not-a-parable/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"This is Not a Parable"},{"content":"You asked for it. This is my off-the-cuff list. I\u0026rsquo;m sure I\u0026rsquo;ll think of other things.\nCode Editing Coda has an annoying habit of treating \u0026lt; and \u0026gt; as angle brackets in ruby files when you have \u0026ldquo;Automatically close brackets\u0026rdquo; turned on.\nCode handles \u0026lt; in Javascript cleanly.\nBut…\nBut in Ruby code it gets confused.\nNote that there are no angle brackets in ruby, so there\u0026rsquo;s no need to auto-close them in .rb files at all. (It is trickier in .html.erb files, but you handle switching between ruby and html well in those already.)\nAlso, you\u0026rsquo;ve got a few minor-but-annoying syntax coloring issues. The most destructive is bad handling of nested interpolations in ruby code:\nNested string interpolation can cause Code to color everything after as a string.\nBut there are a few others:\nCoda has trouble when keywords appear in symbols and method names. And it doens\u0026rsquo;t seem to understand quoted symbols.\nIn a perfect world, I\u0026rsquo;d be able to mix ruby with HTML or Javascript in an ERB template and get proper output. CSS, YAML, and XML would be nice too. In fact, because of mysterious Rails magic, all .yml files should probably be treated as .yml.erb.\nPreview and Terminal Tabs Confuse Me A rails developer almost certainly spends a lot of time on the terminal. Personally, I like having coda combine my terminals and code into one window. This way I can have two or three Rails projects open at the same time, each self-contained. (This is something I do a lot.)\nMy typical setup is:\nA horizontally-split terminal tab; top tails my log, bottom is where I run migrations, use the console, do commits, etc\u0026hellip; A bajillion edit tabs A separate browser open for testing And a very typical use pattern is to do some work, accumulating several edit tabs in the process. Complete some work. Commit the changes. Right -click on the terminal tab and click Close Other Tabs. Then start over again with a clean slate.\nGiven this usage pattern, I have a few complaints:\nI would prefer to preview in coda. But this is impractical for two reasons. Most importantly, the preview tabs get \u0026ldquo;lost\u0026rdquo; among the noise of edit tabs. Also, the whole idea of previewing a \u0026ldquo;file\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t really make sense in Rails. I can open a new tab, switch to preview, then navigate to my local server, but it is inconvenient. I don\u0026rsquo;t really \u0026ldquo;get\u0026rdquo; the idea of switching an edit tab into a terminal. It seems like the behavior is just sort of what happens when you put the Terminal button next to Edit, CSS, and Preview in an HTML editor, even though it doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense. For me (me! me! me!) I think a more useful paradigm would be for the Preview, Terminal, and Edit buttons to act like mode switches for the whole window rather than the current tab. Then I could:\nClick \u0026ldquo;Terminal\u0026rdquo; to see my two or three full-size open terminal tabs, do some generators, and run a migration. Click \u0026ldquo;Edit\u0026rdquo; to go back to my 15 open editors and make some code changes. Click \u0026ldquo;Preview\u0026rdquo; to switch to my two open preview tabs to check the results. Click \u0026ldquo;Terminal\u0026rdquo; to get back to the terminals again because my code (of course) is perfect and I\u0026rsquo;m ready to commit. Click \u0026ldquo;Edit\u0026rdquo; and quickly close all the tabs to get to a clean starting place for my next task. All the while, my terminals and preview tabs stay open and ready. (For this to all work just right, the Local URL I set in the Site settings should not be augmented with the current file path.)\nOf course this is really a deviation from The Way Coda Works, so take it with a grain of salt.\nTL;DR version:\nI only ever have one or two terminal tabs per window. I only really want one or two preview tabs per window. These tabs easily get lost in the shuffle of edit tabs. Speaking of Terminals: Speed Since Rails devs spend a lot of time on the terminal, we care a lot about how well it works. Coda\u0026rsquo;s terminal is, in general really nice. (It does have some coloring bugs that I am hard-pressed to describe or reproduce \u0026ndash; suffice it to say sometimes rails log file highlighting goes nuts.) My only real complaint is speed. Heaven forbid I run a rails console task that generates 10,000 lines of development log output while my server is open in a terminal tab. The next time I do a web action, rails built in server dumps the log up to the end, and it takes about 15 thousand hours for all those lines to scroll by in Coda\u0026rsquo;s terminal. The OSX built in terminal does not have this problem.\nOh, and Command-K should clear the current Terminal. And it should work even if the Terminal isn\u0026rsquo;t so full it scrolls. This is consistent with the OSX terminal and Console.app.\nLog Tailing One of the terminal tabs I keep open is the rails log. Like a lot of Rails devs, I\u0026rsquo;m likely to start using Pow for my projects, which means I won\u0026rsquo;t need to run the rails server manually in each project. (It also means I can keep the servers running for multiple projects at the same time, and I can test more complex use cases). But I still want to see my logs.\nAlong with its Terminal and Preview tabs, it would be lovely if Coda had a Log tab that tailed the file you point it at. Bonus points for a \u0026ldquo;Clean\u0026rdquo; command to clear its scrollback buffer quickly and easily. Double prizes if I can filter the log lines (live) with a regex pattern.\nDefault Terminals Once I open a terminal the first time in a new Site, Coda remembers that I want my terminals local instead of SSH (thanks!). It would be great if I could configure one or more terminals I always want when I open this site. (Ie, one \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; terminal, one that runs rails c, and one that runs mysql -u root, or whatever.)\nSome Code Completion Code Completion is understandably hard in a dynamic language like Ruby. The last thing I want is for Coda to start acting like Eclipse, cooking my lap, spinning my fans, and hiccuping during basic text entry. I keep code completion strictly optional (via Escape or F5) because I find it distracting. But it is really nice when I want it. Like here:\nCode completion works great in CSS.\nAlong these lines, a few rails code completions would be nice, like:\nCode completion suggestions for common rails methods would be really nice.\n(I just shed a small tear of joy).\nI think a great first start would be options hash completions for associations and migrations:\nhas_many has_one belongs_to has_and_belongs_to_many add_column remove_column add_index remove_index There are probably a few other low-hanging-fruit(s?).\nMercurial Support Oh wait, that has nothing to do with Rails. Never mind.\nThank you for asking!\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/posterous/ways-coda-could-improve-rails-support/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Ways Coda Could Improve Rails Support"},{"content":" They\u0026rsquo;re called \u0026ldquo;essential\u0026rdquo; for a reason, Bill.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure making the world a worse place for everyone just because some loser didn\u0026rsquo;t pay for Windows is a good idea\u0026hellip; This is like a law that if someone steals they are no longer allowed to get vaccinations.

KITCHEN\nCharlie\u0026rsquo;s mother (who is an overweight Jew with a strong New York accent for some reason) speaks to the phone.\nCHARLIE\u0026rsquo;S MOTHER: \u0026ldquo;Its just so unnatural, dear.\u0026rdquo;\nPause\nCHARLIE\u0026rsquo;S MOTHER: \u0026ldquo;Well have you tried not having an alien growing inside your stomach?\u0026rdquo;\nPause\nCHARLIE\u0026rsquo;S MOTHER: \u0026ldquo;I just mean…You could try is all I\u0026rsquo;m saying. For your Mother.\u0026rdquo;\nCROSSFADE TO\nINT. GROCERY STORE\nCharlie, whose stomach is now visibly enlarged, adds cheap packaged foods to his grocery cart. He pauses at the end of the pet food aisle. Perspective is such that the meat counter at the other end of the aisle seems infinitely far away, the shelves and shelves of pet food, distorted and elongated, dominate the frame.\nFADE THROUGH WHITE TO\nINT. HOSPITAL EXAM ROOM\nCharlie, shirtless and on the steel table again, looks with terror at the female doctor. Behind her, you can just make out x-ray film clipped to a light box showing a dark and difficult-to-discern shape.\nCHARLIE: \u0026ldquo;What am I?\u0026rdquo;\nFADE THROUGH BLACK TO\nINT. RESTAURANT\nCharlie and a beautiful woman sit opposite one another at a table. Charlie pushes back from the table and doubles over in pain.\nBEAUTIFUL WOMAN: \u0026ldquo;Charlie! What is it?!\u0026rdquo;\nA closeup of Charlie\u0026rsquo;s face reveals a moment of panic, quickly replaced by steely determination.\nCHARLIE: (with determination) \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s time.\u0026rdquo;\nHe clutches his stomach again.\nFADE THROUGH BLACK TO\nINT. HOSPITAL PATIENT ROOM\nCharlie lays in the bed wearing a hospital gown. Monitors flash and beep behind him.\nZoom out to reveal the Predator sitting on a mauve padded chair beside the bed, looking uneasy. The Predator places his talon in Charlie\u0026rsquo;s hand. Charlie squeezes.\nPREDATOR: (in a faltering, alien voice) \u0026ldquo;Are you…comfortable?\u0026rdquo;\nFADE THROUGH BLACK TO\nINT. HOSPITAL PATIENT ROOM\nCharlie\u0026rsquo;s face fills the frame, his eyes squeezed shut, teeth bared in agony, he braces himself against a terrible pain. Pan and zoom out to reveal hospital equipment. A harsh halogen light hovers over Charlie, washing out the frame. The Alien\u0026rsquo;s head appears as she leans over charlie. She presses her forehead to his, and the connection blocks the harsh light. The noises of the monitors and commotion fade. She slowly opens her cavernous mouth, revealing threatening fangs dripping with mucosal saliva. A smaller mouth, whitish, emerges from inside the large mouth, extending on the end of a long, inflexible, esophageal neck. The second mouth \u0026ldquo;stares\u0026rdquo; directly into Charlie\u0026rsquo;s eyes.\nSECOND MOUTH: \u0026ldquo;PUUUUUUSH!!!\u0026rdquo;\nFADE TO BLACK\n\u0026ldquo;Alien Vs.

A few years ago I was working on site with a client in Tempe. I had use of a private office and a keyboard, mouse, and screen to which I could attach my laptop. But I prefer the laptop mouse and keyboard in most cases, so I would connect only the screen, as a secondary display, to make use of on occasion. Under most circumstances, the second screen was empty, aside from the background picture my computer displays, which is randomly selected from a collection of family photos I\u0026rsquo;ve set aside for the purpose.\nOn this day, the picture shown prominently beside me while I worked was an overexposed mistake of a photograph I took while playing around with the settings on my wife\u0026rsquo;s camera.\nIsabel at eight years old sitting on the trampoline.\nThis is my child, Isabel when they were about eight. Despite its technical failings, I thought the picture looked neat. I love Isabel\u0026rsquo;s curious, averted look (they\u0026rsquo;re fiddling with a different camera below the crop), and the strange way the grid pattern of the block wall came through.\nFor the client, I was working on a complicated project to reproduce paper engineering documents in a digital form. These documents were \u0026ldquo;controlled,\u0026rdquo; meaning each was approved by an engineer any time a change was made, and sometimes audited by the FAA. Since I don\u0026rsquo;t know the first thing about fixing airplanes, I worked closely with a man named Tony, who was responsible for the engineering department at this company.\nOne day Tony came into my office to bring me some documents he had marked with corrections. He looked at the picture shining 24 inches diagonal on my desk and said, \u0026ldquo;You a Dakota Fanning fan?\u0026rdquo; In case you don\u0026rsquo;t know, Dakota Fanning is a young female actor who was, at the time, probably 13 years old. She doesn\u0026rsquo;t look much like Isabel, but I suppose if you over-expose a picture enough…\nUnfortunately, I was completely focused on a programming problem and I did what I often do, and what generally gets me into trouble. I conversed agreeably and without thought. \u0026ldquo;Sure.\u0026rdquo; I said. \u0026ldquo;You?\u0026rdquo; Some part of my brain was wondering why Tony was asking me about Dakota Fanning. It was cross referencing our past conversations looking for some explanation. It was suggesting, probably urgently, that I pay more attention to the conversation and figure out what I was agreeing to. But I just kept working.\nTony left the papers, and I thanked him. He returned to his office. And then, some time later, after I had finished whatever I was doing, I finally internalized the conversation that had passed between us. I looked at the screen beside me and put the pieces together.\nTony, a man I respected, a man whose opinion mattered to me, now believed that I, a 30 year old man, would keep a photograph of a pretty 13 year old celebrity on my screen. He probably imagined my office at home with magazine cutouts of Dakota Fanning pinned all over the walls. He presumed I spent my weekends rewatching Charlotte\u0026rsquo;s Web and War of the Worlds (two movies I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen), all the while gazing dreamily at a child.\nI threw up a little bit in my mouth.\nI tried to find him, but he wasn\u0026rsquo;t in his cubicle. By the time I saw him next (probably a week later) it seemed too awkward to bring up again, so I let it slide. That\u0026rsquo;s why I know, to this day, that someone out there thinks I\u0026rsquo;m a skeeze.

Gruber posits that this is a bad thing dressed up to look like a good thing. But really, it is a good thing.\nThe whole point of OAuth is to allow me to authorize one service (like Flickr, Posterous, FourSquare, Instagram, or, yes, even a full Twitter client) to interact with another service (like Twitter) on my behalf without giving them my password. From the OAuth about page:\nOAuth is about giving access to your stuff without sharing your identity at all.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the thing. When you give some service your Twitter username and password, at least three bad things happen:\nThe service itself, anyone who works for whoever runs the service, or anyone who ever steals their data has your username and password. They can operate on your behalf on twitter in any way they see fit, including deleting your data, closing your account, sending tweets, approving follow request, following other people, reading private information, changing your profile, etc… If, like a vast majority of people, you use the same username and password for other services like Gmail, Amazon.com, or your work VPN, all those people can do all kinds of other things on your behalf. In this sense, it isn\u0026rsquo;t just like giving away your house key. It\u0026rsquo;s like giving away your entire keyring, with the keys to your office, mailbox and car. If you ever change your password, the service will stop working. This is especially annoying with something like Twitter, which you might have connected to several services. OAuth solves all these problems:\nAlthough in general OAuth still allows the service to act on your behalf, they are limited to the sorts of access appropriate from the API. They can\u0026rsquo;t decide instead to log in as you, pretend to be you, and do things an API doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow. And OAuth makes it easy for you to take away their access in the future if you decide to, without interfering with other systems you\u0026rsquo;ve granted access. Finally, OAuth supports the idea that you might want to limit the kinds of access you\u0026rsquo;re granting. This is exactly what Twitter is doing with OAuth: Allowing you to decide if the third party client can read your direct messages. Since you never divulge your password to any third party during an OAuth transaction, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to trust every single third party application to treat your password with respect. You only need to trust Twitter with that sensitive information. This helps bolster the third party ecosystem by reducing the trust level required of a client. If I change my password, it has no impact on services that use my account with OAuth. Instead, I manage their access through a separate, and very straighforward interface. Gruber points out that with Twitter\u0026rsquo;s old xAuth authentication system, the third party service only holds the password for a moment, while establishing the connection, They then forget the password. This solves problem #3, but it does absolutely nothing to fix the first two problems unless you trust the third party to do the right thing out of the goodness of their hearts.\nHe also gripes about the fact that Twitter\u0026rsquo;s own native client won\u0026rsquo;t use OAuth, as though this proves that the OAuth requirement is bunk. But, of course, Twitter already has your password. If you don\u0026rsquo;t trust Twitter with your username and password, then you don\u0026rsquo;t trust Twitter, period. It is 100% reasonable for Twitter\u0026rsquo;s own clients to use a less cumbersome authentication scheme.\nThe most important thing to understand, though, is that the purpose of OAuth is not to make savvy hacker nerds safer. I am perfectly capable of protecting my Twitter credentials, using multiple passwords, sniffing out spammy sites, and so on. But Twitter has hundreds of millions of users, many of whom are not (and should not have to be) technology-savvy. If Twitter offers an alternate authentication mechanism to OAuth, then unscrupulous phishers and spammers will use it, and Twitter users will continue to be taken in. The only way to fix that problem is to remove the ability for third party applications to access Twitter accounts in an unsafe way.\nI completely agree that the OAuth flow is cumbersome compared to the alternative. But that just means we should be working to make OAuth better (or find a better alternative). Of course everybody gets that OAuth isn\u0026rsquo;t ideal for native clients. (Although I think Gruber over-states the case. It is, in practice, fairly smooth and easy to get a client connected to Twitter using OAuth if the client is implemented well.)\nThe OAuth people know, better than anyone, that this is a problem. From the proposed OAuth 2.0 introduction page:\nIn practice, the flow works fine for web-based applications but provides an inferior experience elsewhere.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s keep our eyes on the ball.\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/posterous/oauth-is-right-for-twitter/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"OAuth is Right for Twitter"},{"content":"I wrote this poem for Isabel\u0026rsquo;s friend, who was collecting poems about Guinea Pigs for a project:\nGuinea Pig, O’ Guinea Pig\nI have bad news for thee\nTho’ your name is Guinea Pig\nYou are no pig to me\nFor pigs are big, and round, and snort\nAnd dig all day in dirt\nBut all you ever seem to do\nIs pee upon my shirt\nPigs, what's more, make bacon crisp\nA truly perfect food\nBut bacon from a Guinea Pig\nIs never very good\nGuinea Pig, O’ Guinea Pig\nYou furry little friend\nI'm glad you don't belong to me\nFor I would be your end\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/posterous/guinea-pig-a-poem/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Guinea Pig: A Poem"},{"content":"I had to put this in some documentation I wrote for a client.\nGo Daddy will try very hard from now on to “up sell” you with additional names and services.

The neighborhood this street was part of backed up to a small strip of young but wild wood about a quarter mile wide, and this, beginning with a long downward slope, formed the barrier between our back yard and the farm fields and county roads beyond. My brother and I spent long afternoons in what we called “the ravine,” climbing trees, chasing squirrels, and generally reveling in a place protected from parental view. “To the woods!” was our stock answer to the ever-present question of the time: “Where are you going?” The woods had its limitations, however. In particular, it had no friends, and it afforded no opportunity to ride a bicycle. And so at some point, earlier in my childhood than the specificity of memory, we began to explore in the other direction, up the street.\nThe configuration of the streets was such that to gain access to the rest of the neighborhood, we had to travel along our street, past the two corner houses, and onto the adjoining road. It was a bit of very bad luck that those two houses, like sentinel towers guarding the way in and out of a prison, were home to Jason on the left, and Paul on the right. They were, and I say this without a hint of hyperbole, the two meanest boys I have ever known. Paul and Jason were three or four years older than me and they seemed to possess a hatred of everything and everyone; A quality that results in a relentless need to exert power for its own sake. Young boys, as a general rule, have no real power, and so they approximate it through victimization. We, as much younger boys of eight or nine years, were naive enough to believe that these bullies might, possibly, kill us one of these times, and that proper fear made us ideal victims.\nFor several years, every time we conspired to leave our corner of the world, my brother and I would weigh the risk of being caught by Paul or Jason or, worst of all, both of them together. The harassment often took the usual forms. Jason, for instance, was fond of entrapment. He might wrap his arm around my neck, the crook of his elbow leaving just enough space for my trachea to admit a little air. He would often ask how I liked this, although I rarely gave this question much consideration as I struggled to break free. Other times he would push my brother to the ground and sit on his chest. He sang a sort of triumphant song when he did this.\nPaul was more of a prop man. He had a BB gun, for instance. It may as well have been an assault rifle as far as I understood things then. I certainly believed it could kill me. He would aim the gun at us as we rode our bicycles up the street and ask, loudly, if we’d like to be shot today. One halloween he had a package of bottle rockets, which were the sort of illegal fireworks that elicited a great deal of awe in those days. He shot one at my brother, hitting him square in the chest. It hovered there—pressing against his chest as it expended the last of its propellent—for what seemed like a very long time, but must really have been no more than a second. The explosion that eventually came left a small burn hole in his shirt and we were genuinely surprised he was not more seriously hurt. I think we concluded it has been a “dud” and called ourselves lucky that day.\nOne day, I don’t remember how old we were, we made a life-saving discovery. We were playing in what we called The Dead Forest, which was a section of the woods where, for unknown reasons, every tree was dead. Hundreds of young trees, no more than three or four inches in diameter, stood straight and tall and leafless. They had evidently been this way for many years because their trunks were brittle and dry. We could push the smaller trees over with our hands. The Dead Forest was a long way from our back yard, down the ravine and past the doctor’s lawn mower shed. Beyond The Dead Forest was The Old House, which was a partially-covered platform held up by a tree. In hindsight, it was probably an aborted attempt at a treehouse started by boys like us years before. We thought of The Old House as something very far away, and also very dangerous. I remember my brother climbed up into it once, and I was convinced he was taking too great a risk. On the day of the discovery, for the first time, we walked up the hill at the point of The Old House. As we crested the hill we were surprised to find a tennis court, guarded by a tall chain link fence. It was the very same court that could be found in the back yard of the family across the street from Drew\u0026rsquo;s house. It is strange to think now that we never before realized our woods connected with the rest of the neighborhood, but at the time this seemed like magic.\nWe had found a way to bypass Paul and Jason, and so we started walking our bikes through the woods most days. For a long time we came and went as we pleased.\nWe were doing exactly this one day when Paul and Jason materialized among the arboreal tombstones of The Dead Forest. I remember it vividly. My brother was 20 feet ahead of me when he yelled, “Run!” I didn’t want to leave my bicycle, and it was a struggle to push it through the leafy mulch and vegetal tangle of the forest floor. Before I got far, Paul had me by the wrist. Jason held my brother in the characteristic “head lock.” Paul pulled me towards the others, and the two tormentors discussed what to do with their quarry. Paul had with him a jumprope, the kind that is a thin cord strung with a hundred plastic tube-like beads of alternating white and blue. The kind that pinches your hands a little when you carry it in a bunch. He insinuated that they could tie us to a tree. There was talk of making us take off our clothes. In the end, they announced the decision to “cut [us] up.” Paul produced a pitch fork, which had been resting alongside a shovel against a nearby tree. While Jason pressed my brother against a tree, Paul held the tines of the pitchfork inches from his face, threatening to stab him or blind him or who knows what. I was no longer being held, and I only stood there, watching, unable to come to any conclusion. The fear pressed down on me more suffocatingly here, off the street and away from even the remotest possibility of adult rescue. I thought I would probably cry if I was in my brother’s position. For his part, although his lower lip betrayed his abject terror, he did not cry. He actually talked down to Paul, I remember. “I know why you’re doing this, Paul,” he said. “It makes you feel big.” I thought I might be sick.\nI can’t remember how the skirmish ended. I’m quite certain we weren’t killed. There may have been some light punches mingled with more intimidation. It did end, though, somehow, and as far as I remember, we never spoke of it again.\nSome months went by and things stayed largely the same. And then one day we came home from a day of playing, and my mother asked us to sit with her at the kitchen table. It was dark in the house after being outside in the summer sun, and there was a quality in the atmosphere of the room that made it plain she had something important to say. She told us, haltingly, that there had been an “accident.” Jason was dead. The doctor with the lawn mower shed had administered to Jason, but there was nothing, really, to be done. She wasn’t sure how well we knew Jason, and she wanted to know how we felt. In hindsight, I imagine she was worried about how we might respond if we learned this news in the presence of neighbors. Jason’s death was taboo because, as I learned a few years later, he had hung himself with a belt from the chinning bar in his bedroom.\nI don’t remember everything my mother said that afternoon. She probably told us it was all right to be scared, or sad, or confused. My understanding of death at that point in my life was simply this: My mother had a father, but my father did not. His father had died a year before I was born. And that was the closest I had ever come to death. It would be two or three more years before my neighbor Megan’s grandmother would die, and she would tell me how she felt. It would be seven or eight more years before my own grandmother would die. But I understood the basics: You die, and then you aren’t alive anymore.\nMy mother asked us how we felt. And this is how I felt: Relieved. It was a gift. My life would enjoy a 50% reduction in complexity. My mother’s sobriety made it clear that I should not express this relief enthusiastically, and so I looked at my feet and quietly told her that Jason was mean and that I was happy he was dead. I don’t remember the words of her reply. She didn’t scold me, but she made it clear that the death of a young person is a tragedy without respect to circumstances. She said he had “difficulties”, and that we must remember that his death had brought a great deal of sadness to his family.\nFor the first time in my life, I tried to imagine Jason with a mother. I tried to picture a kind woman holding him in a loving embrace, but no image would form from the haze of such impossibility. I told her I would try to understand, and she kissed me on the head and told me she loved me.\nFor some time, I thought about Jason’s death. I tried to make myself feel sad for Jason, but I couldn’t do it. The one certain thought I could embrace with respect to his suicide was this: I wanted to live my life in such a way that nobody would celebrate my death. I suppose I should thank him for that.\nIt’s been a long time since I’ve thought about these things. There was a tree planted in the soccer park in our home town, with a plaque by it that invoked the memory of Jason. I suppose the last time I really thought about him was when I visited that park in high school. Of course now looking back I can see the tragedy of the death of a young boy with struggles beyond my comprehension at the time. But the anger of the bullied dies hard and mostly I remember how cruel he was.\nI watched the announcement of the death of Osama Bin Ladin live on Sunday night. My wife and children were with me. At one point, the CNN photojournalist aimed the camera across the White House lawn, where a crowd had gathered against the gates. My fellow Americans were exuberant. At one point they took up a chant of “USA! USA!” It was reported that similar ad hoc rallies were springing up around the country. Times Square was mentioned. And my feelings were mixed. Like a lot of people, I was put off by the cheering. Osama Bin Ladin was less than a man, and I do not mourn his death. But I could not bring myself to cheer. It is possible my mood was softened by the presence of my young children, for whom I wish the world was only good.\nSince then, many people have said they were disgusted by the exuberance. They say that it is sick and wrong to celebrate any loss of life. I stop short of that declaration as well. Although I can’t bring myself to feel joy in the face of an act of violence, I understand, accept, and perhaps even respect that same reaction from others. And I suppose, in a small way, I’ve been there before.\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/posterous/the-dead-forest-celebration/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"The Dead Forest Celebration"},{"content":"Sophia can do wonders with a blanket…\nSophia \u0026ldquo;dressed up\u0026rdquo; as Quirrell from Harry Potter.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/posterous/quirrell/","tags":["Archive Post","Photos"],"title":"Quirrell"},{"content":"My wife (not pictured) is teaching kids to sew today.\nA whole pile of kids learning to sew.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/posterous/sewing-party/","tags":["Archive Post","Photos"],"title":"Sewing Party"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve been a Vonnegut fan since I was in high school.

With other versions of Rails, you may get a different error, but the underlying cause is the same. The internet is rife with suggestions that may or may not be helpful with various version combinations. But none of them helped in my case.\nThe root cause of this problem is that the MySQL gem is built with a dependency on the MySQL client library by name only. This library is not in a standard library path. So you either need to update your library path to include /usr/local/mysql/bin (which is a pain) or fix the gem itself, which I what I decided to do.\nOnce you have built the gem, you need to find it in the filesystem. For a normal Mac OS X install, it is in /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/. If you use rvm, it is probably somwehere in ~/.rvm/gems depending on the gemset you\u0026rsquo;re using. If you\u0026rsquo;re not sure, run:\ngem env Which will report, among other things, your GEM PATHS. Look in each path listed for mysql-2.8.1. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve found it, run this command, substituting {GEM_PATH} with the path to your gems:\ninstall_name_tool -change libmysqlclient.18.dylib /usr/local/mysql/lib/libmysqlclient.18.dylib {GEM_PATH}/mysql-2.8.1/lib/mysql_api.bundle This command rewrites the compiled gem bundle so that its reference to the MySQL client library uses an absolute path. (The path I\u0026rsquo;m using is the location where MySQL installs its libraries by default if you build from source or use the installer. It is possible you installed it somewhere else.)\nHope it helps.\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/posterous/fixing-one-variant-of-uninitialized-constant-mysql-compat-mysql-res/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Fixing uninitialized constant MysqlCompat::MysqlRes"},{"content":"[the smoke detector in our house chirps a low battery warning]\nSOPHIA: \u0026ldquo;Ugh!

The blue Mac OS logo definitely did not originate in the 1980s. I remember clearly when this logo was introduced, first in the press and then in the Mac OS startup splash screen. If memory serves, this was somewhere around 1994 or 1995 and Mac OS 7.6ish. (Incidentally, it was around the same time Mac OS started being called Mac OS. Before that, if you can believe it, it was just called \u0026ldquo;The System\u0026rdquo; or more specifically, System 7.)\nIf I have my facts straight, this logo came to be because Apple was beginning to authorize clone computers that would run their operating system. They needed a \u0026ldquo;Mac\u0026rdquo; logo distinct from the five-color Apple logo. Clones could carry this blue logo, but of course they couldn\u0026rsquo;t use the Apple logo itself.\nThe clones eventually went away, and this logo took a back seat in Mac OS X, where the newer solid color Apple logo takes prominence.

OnObjectModify fires when you modify the contents of a field. OnObjectValidate and OnObjectSave fire when you exit a field after making changes. OnObjectExit fires when you exit a field, even if you haven’t made changes. Note: Throughout this article, I’ll be focusing on field triggers. Many of these triggers do different things when attached to other layout objects. But for today, assume you’ve attached these triggers to a field object. I wanted to make a diagram that shows how FileMaker processes field triggers in an effort to make it clearer. My first attempt sort of had the opposite effect, which just demonstrates that this stuff is kind of complicated. Luckily, I went back to the drawing board and tried again.\nFirst, this is what happens, from a trigger perspective, when you exit a field in FileMaker Pro 10:\nA lot goes on between pressing tab and actually getting out of the field.\nAt the top, you start to exit the field. (This can happen in a lot of ways. You can tab to the next field in the tab order, click outside the field, change records, switch layouts, close the window, run the Go To Field or Commit Records script step, switch to Preview Mode, quit FileMaker, shutdown your computer, subject the universe to false vacuum decay, …wait I got carried away. But there are lots of ways to leave a field.)\nFileMaker checks to see if you made any field changes. If not, it skips right ahead to the OnObjectExit trigger. But if you did make changes, FileMaker goes through all the steps. First, it validates the field. This takes two forms:\nFileMaker makes sure what you typed makes sense for this field. For instance, if this is a date field, and you typed “Hi Mom” you’ll get an error.\nIf you set up any validations in the field options, FileMaker runs them now as well.\nAs you are no doubt aware, failed validations result in an error message, something like this:\nTrigger warning: enraging.\nOnce a validation error happens, FileMaker drops you back in the field and the process ends. You have to fix the error or revert the field before you can really exit.\nIf validation passes, FileMaker goes on to run your OnObjectModify and OnObjectExit triggers. As usual, if the triggered scripts exit with a False result, FileMaker stops the exit and leaves you in the field. Otherwise, the exit is done. All this happens in the microsecond after you try to exit a field.\nOnObjectValidate That is good stuff. You can inject your special scripted behavior into the field exit process, and you decide if you want it to happen only when the field was changed, or any time the field is exited (or, I suppose, both). But you don’t have quite as much control as you might want. FileMaker runs those pesky validations before your triggers. If you want to do something with the field value before validations run, you’re out of luck.\nThis limitation was, apparently, annoying enough that the FileMaker PTB decided to do something about it. In FileMaker Pro 11, the exit field process now looks like this:\nOnObjectValidate fires early in the field exit process.\nSharp-eyed readers will note that the OnObjectValidate trigger politely fires after you start exiting the field, but before validations run.\nScript triggers are all about inserting customized behavior into FileMaker’s normal processes, and with this new trigger, you get one more angle of attack (or, some might say, one more \u0026ldquo;hook,\u0026rdquo; as in, \u0026ldquo;I can hook in to the process in a new place.\u0026rdquo;) OnObjectValidate scripts can process field data before FileMaker validates the field, and before the user ever sees an error message.\nPut It To Use So what can you do with it? Probably lots of things. Here’s the example I showed in my presentation at DevCon 2010. Suppose you have a date field into which you often enter dates in the near future. Someone might call and say, “I want an appointment on Thursday.” If you’re like me, this request triggers a thought process something like this:\n”Ok, so today is, um, Monday. And it is the tenth. No, the eleventh. No, what date is it? [checks]. Oh, the 28th. Wow. Where did the time go? Anyway, Monday, the 28th. And Thursday is [on my fingers] Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday — three days from now. That’s the 31st. Wait, this is September. That has, um, [on my knuckles] January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September — 30 days. So the first. I’m about 75% sure Thursday is October 1st. Man, somebody should make this easier.” My Psyche Ok, so most of you probably aren’t quite as bad as I am at this stuff, but who wouldn’t prefer to just type “Thursday” and be done with it?\nAs a FileMaker power programmer, you can probably think of 42 ways to let a person type “Thursday” and have FileMaker put in the right date. But with script triggers in 11 you can do it with style:\nThis method requires no extra fields or pop-up windows. Your date field stays a real date field, which is just better. You don’t have to click any special buttons, or layer buttons over the field, and rely on spurious timing assumptions. Instead, just type a word directly in a date field, then use a script to fix it up when you exit the field. Best of all, it is pretty simple. The trickiest part is writing a calculation that turns words into dates. Here’s mine:\nSmartDate :=\nCase( value = \u0026#34;today\u0026#34;; Get(CurrentDate); value = \u0026#34;tomorrow\u0026#34;; Get(CurrentDate) + 1; value = \u0026#34;yesterday\u0026#34;; Get(CurrentDate) - 1; value = \u0026#34;sunday\u0026#34; or value = \u0026#34;sun\u0026#34;; DateOfDay ( 1 ); value = \u0026#34;monday\u0026#34; or value = \u0026#34;mon\u0026#34;; DateOfDay ( 2 ); value = \u0026#34;tuesday\u0026#34; or value = \u0026#34;tue\u0026#34;; DateOfDay ( 3 ); value = \u0026#34;wednesday\u0026#34; or value = \u0026#34;wed\u0026#34;; DateOfDay ( 4 ); value = \u0026#34;thursday\u0026#34; or value = \u0026#34;thu\u0026#34;; DateOfDay ( 5 ); value = \u0026#34;friday\u0026#34; or value = \u0026#34;fri\u0026#34;; DateOfDay ( 6 ); value = \u0026#34;saturday\u0026#34; or value = \u0026#34;sat\u0026#34;; DateOfDay ( 7 ) ) I put this in a custom function. As you can probably guess, it turns words like Today, Tomorrow, Yesterday, Saturday, and Mon into reasonable dates. It uses this (complicated) custom function, which figure out the date for a given day number:\nDateOfDay :=\nLet( x = dayNum - DayOfWeek ( Get(CurrentDate) ); If(x \u0026lt;= 0; x + 7; x) + Get(CurrentDate) ) ) Tip: Note: You could easily extend the SmartDate function to handle more complex expressions like “Next Thursday” or “Last Friday” or even “Bastille Day.” Whatever makes your socks go up and down. Next, I use this function in a very simple script:\nIf [ Not IsEmpty(SmartDate(My Table::My Date Field)) ] Set Field [ My Table::My Date Field ; SmartDate(My Table::My Date Field) ] End If Finally, set this script as the OnObjectValidate trigger script for the date field. Now, when you type “Thursday” into the field, FileMaker does all the thinking for you, and swaps in the right date.\nA Defensive If You may be wondering why I bother with the If in my script. Why not have SmartDate return the original value if it doesn’t match one of the special conditions? This is how I first wrote it. But it has an annoying side effect: When you put something invalid in the date field, it changes to a question mark when you try to exit the field. You still see FileMaker’s date error dialog box, but you’ve lost what you typed, so it is harder to go back in and fix a typo. This happens because the script uses the Set Field step to insert invalid data into the date field, and FileMaker puts a question mark in the field in this case. I decided it was best to leave the field alone if I couldn’t figure out what to do with it. Hence, the If. This kind of technique wouldn’t work at all in FileMaker 10. Because validations run before OnObjectSave and OnObjectExit, FileMaker’s invalid date error message will always appear before your script can do anything about it. This is exactly why OnObjectValidate exists. It gives you a little more control.\nWhich to Use? You might think I’m saying OnObjectValidate is better than OnObjectSave, but you’d be wrong. The truth is, in most cases, OnObjectSave is probably the right trigger to use. That way you can be sure you’re dealing with valid data in your trigger script. OnObjectValidate should only be used when you explicitly want your script to run before validation for some reason.\nBonus Technique I’m going to channel my inner Don Levan here, and propose a slight modification to the script. This is by no means a necessary change. But for the adventurous, this version of the script is generic. By that, I mean one script can be used with as many different date fields as you want.\nHere’s the script:\nIf [ Not IsEmpty(SmartDate(Get(ActiveFieldContents))) ] Set Field [ SmartDate(Get(ActiveFieldContents)) ] End If With these changes in place, your trigger works exactly as it did before. But now, you can wire a second, third, or 144th date field to the same script. Easy Peasy Pumpkin Squeezy. Or something like that.\nCool, huh?\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/sfr/the-on-object-validate-trigger/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"The OnObjectValidate Trigger"},{"content":"Blast.\nTriple letter on the Q and triple word, too…\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/posterous/it-has-come-to-my-attention-that-i-require-a-larger-board/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"It has Come to My Attention that I Require a Larger Board"},{"content":"That\u0026rsquo;s my girl!\nSophia (left) and her dear friend Zha-zha.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/posterous/if-you-ever-wanted-to-understand-about-sophia/","tags":["Archive Post","Photos"],"title":"If You Ever Wanted to Understand Sophia…"},{"content":"I say no.\nIsabel found a mud puddle.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/posterous/is-isabel-to-big-to-play-in-the-rain-i-say-no/","tags":["Archive Post","Photos"],"title":"Is Isabel Too Big to Play in the Rain?"},{"content":"I just noticed this.

Someone much wiser than me once said something like this: “My only comfort is that I tried. My only regret is that I failed.” I’ll leave it at that.\nIn short order, I’ll be posting our first new article in over 18 months. But first I thought I’d share a little news. For those who are here for great FileMaker info, feel free to skip ahead. (And let’s be honest, that’s the only reason any of you are here.)\nAs many of you have noticed, my name is not on the cover of FileMaker Pro 11: The Missing Manual. Since I know a lot of people will ask, here’s the scoop:\nI love O’Reilly and we had (have?) a fantastic relationship. I still remember the first O’Reilly book I ever read (The Camel Book), and the awe I felt at its immense quality. It was absolutely an honor to work with a company whose product I respect so much.\nIt should go without saying, but I love my former co-author, Susan Prosser, who has been a professional associate and personal friend for years. I loved working on the book. The process was hectic, and aggravating, and fun, and wonderful in a million ways.\nBut writing a book is a labor of love. If you add up all the late nights and killer deadlines and huge work, and divide by the modest revenues, it’s a tough sell. I always considered it worth it because (here comes the honesty) it helped my reputation, helped me sell my services, and was a bit of a thrill. But the calculus has shifted a little. I don’t know how much the book does those things anymore. So when it came time to fire up Microsoft Word (barf) and start in on a revision for 11, I realized I couldn’t justify the stress and life-disruption this time around. This was a personal decision on my part.\nIn the beginning, I wrote the never-publised FileMaker Pro 7, The Missing Manual over months of long nights. Susan later saved my bacon by revising my manuscript for FileMaker 8 so it could see the light of day. I then had the opportunity to work on revisions for 9 and 10 with Susan. In all, we wrote or revised approaching 3,000 pages, over a thousand screen shots and figures, and a dozen screen casts.\nAfter all that, I would be remiss if I didn’t say this: Thank you.\nThank you to Vince Menanno who convinced me to pursue the project in the first place. Thank you to Tim O’Reilly who blew my mind when he responded personally to the inquiry placed on the O’Reilly web side. Thank you to Susan Prosser who literally saved the book from failure, and made later revisions a joy. Thank you to Stuart Gripman of Crooked Arm Consulting who ably picked up the reins for FileMaker 11. Thank you to my first editor, David Pogue—I will never forget the validation I felt as an aspiring writer when he encouraged me along. Thank you to Nan Barber, my editor, who made the book much better than it otherwise could have been. Thank you to my wife Mamie and my children, Isabel and Sophia, who surrendered a husband and father to the computer for a few months every couple of years. And thank you to everyone who read the book, which may include you. (Especially those of you who left positive feedback on Amazon.com 😉).\nI\u0026rsquo;m full of mixed emotions right now. On the one hand it is a relief to watch a new FileMaker release roll out and not be on a deadline. On the other hand, it\u0026rsquo;s a little sad. In some ways I miss the crunch, and especially the deep-dive into the minutia of a new release.\nOk, I’m done with all that now. Back to regularly scheduled (Ha!) programming.\nGeoff\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/sfr/here-at-the-end-of-all-things/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Here at the End of All Things"},{"content":"We start our return to semi-regular writing with a small-but-awesome custom function: Pop. If you grew up in the American mid-west like me you might think I’m talking about [ soda | soda pop | coke | soft drinks ]. But I’m actually talking about stacks. In the computer science world, pop means to take something off the top of a list, and it is exceptionally handy to add this to your FileMaker scripting toolkit.\nLooping Through Lists Imagine you have a list of values. (I know, what a weird concept in a database).\nIsabel Sophia Mamie Geoff Jesse And you want to do something with these items in a script. Typically, for example, you might want to make a new record for each item in the list. You probably already know that FileMaker has several functions designed to make working with return-separated lists easier. For instance, suppose the list above was in a variable called $names. Here are some functions you might use, and their results:\nGetValue($names, 3) =\u0026gt; returns “Mamie” LeftValues($names, 2) =\u0026gt; returns “Isabel¶Sophia¶” MiddleValues($names, 3, 2) =\u0026gt; returns “Mamie¶Geoff¶” RightValues($names, 2) =\u0026gt; returns “Geoff¶Jesse¶” Writing our script using these functions isn’t particularly difficult. Here’s the form we normally use:\n# assume $names has a return-separated list of names # … Loop Exit Loop If [ValueCount($names) = 0] Set Variable [$name, GetValue($names, 1)] New Record/Request Set Field [The Name Field; $name] # set other fields, do more with $name, or whatever* Set Variable [$names, MiddleValues($names, 2, 999999)] End Tip: You might wonder whey I have the Exit Loop If step right after the start of my loop. I do this a lot. It means my loop won’t run even once if the $names variable happens to be empty, which saves me an If step around the loop. Pop: For the Lazy Programmer In Your Life We write scripts like this a lot. We pull the first item out of the variable, use it or store it, and then re-set the variable to remove that first item again. Although it is minor, this is non-ideal for a few reasons:\nThe code is kind of strange. What does this code do? Why all those magic nines?\nAny time you write the same couple of lines over and over again, your inner-time-saver-alert should start buzzing.\nCall me lazy, but I’m always happy to save a few clicks and/or keystrokes.\nAnd so, we wrote Pop. Here it is:\nPop(variableName) := Evaluate( “let([ top = getValue( ” \u0026amp; variableName \u0026amp; ” ; 1 ); ” \u0026amp; variableName \u0026amp; ” = middlevalues(” \u0026amp; variableName \u0026amp; ” ; 2 ; 999999999999999)]; top)” ) In a nutshell, this function takes the name of a variable as its parameter. It returns the first value in the variable and removes that value from the variable all in one step.\nWarning: Pay attention to the previous sentence. The parameter you pass to Pop is the name of a variable, not the variable itself. You want this: Pop(“$variable”), not this: Pop($variable). For the curious, I’ll explain how it works in a moment. But first let’s see it in action. We can now re-write our loop like this:\nLoop Exit Loop If [ValueCount($names) = 0] Set Variable [$name, Pop(“$names”)] New Record/Request Set Field [The Name Field; $name] # set other fields, do more with $name, or whatever End Instead of using GetValue to get the first item in the list, and then removing it later, we do it all in one step using Pop. In fact, since Pop is a function instead of a script step, we can use it right inside other expressions, so we can simplify our loop even more:\nLoop Exit Loop If [ValueCount($names) = 0] New Record/Request Set Field [The Name Field; Pop(“$names”)] # *set other fields, do more with $name, or whatever* End This time, we get the value, remove it from the variable, and put it in the field all in one step. As a function, Pop can be used in other places too, like inside larger expressions:\nSubstitute( $something; [Pop(“$to_remove”); “”]; [Pop(“$to_remove”); “”]; [Pop(“$to_remove”); “”] ) Or in recursive custom functions:\nIf ( ValueCount($whatever) = 0; “”; Pop(“$whatever”) \u0026amp; AmazingFunction ) It is often really handy to be able to combine fetching and removing into one tiny expression.\nHow It Works The Pop function uses an oft-overlooked FileMaker power-function called Evaluate. This is another one of those meta-features in FileMaker. (\u0026ldquo;That was me. That was I. That was the formula of this calculation.\u0026rdquo;) Evaluate lets you process calculations inside your calculations.\nWhen you write a calculation, you combine functions, values, fields, and operators to produce some useful result. Normally that result is some new data to display or use in your scripts. As you no-doubt know, FileMaker’s calculation engine provides some very powerful tools to process input and produce interesting results.\nWhen you use Evaluate, the result of one calculation can be a calculation formula itself. Here’s a trivial example:\nEvaluate(“1 + 2”) In this case, the parameter we’re passing to Evaluate is the text value “1 + 2”. Since this is a valid FileMaker calculation, Evaluate will, well, evaluate it, and the final result of the formula will be 3.\nOf course that example is silly. If I wanted to add 1 and 2 in a calculation, I’d just write it like this, and save a lot of trouble:\n1 + 2 But since this is a calculation, you can get as complicated as you want:\nEvaluate( Choose($something, “Average”, “Min”, “Max”) \u0026amp; “(1, 2, 3)” ) That equally-ridiculous formula will return either an average, minimum, or maximum of the values 1, 2, and 3 depending on the value of $something.\nBut why?! Why would I ever do that?\nWell, you wouldn’t. But using those techniques, you can do all kinds of other cool things, like, oh, for instance, write Pop. All Pop does is generate a new calculation formula that looks like this:\nLet( [ top = GetValue($my_variable, 1); $my_variable = MiddleValues($my_variable, 2, 99999999) ]; top ) In other words, it makes a calculation that removes the first item from a variable and returns it. Since we don’t know the name of the variable ahead of time, we have to work the variable name into the calculation using a calculation. (I know, meta…). Once we’ve built this little formula, we use Evaluate to run it for us.\nEasy as pie (wrapped in cake, wrapped in an enigma).\nWhy Would I Ever Use This If you’re like me, right now you’re thinking this is a lot of work for a very little payoff. It saved a line or two in my loop. But I encourage you to try it out the next time you need to process lists of values. Like all custom functions, it is easy to abstract the complicated part away in your database and never worry about it again, calling on it here and there with an easy name. And that, truth be told, is the core power of programming.\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/sfr/pop-goes-the-variable/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Pop Goes the Variable"},{"content":"This was a fun conference outing.

What extra features does it have?\u0026rdquo;\nSALES REP: \u0026ldquo;That is Model B.

To accommodate an internal antenna, it is thicker and not as beautifully constructed.\u0026rdquo;\nCUSTOMER 1: \u0026ldquo;Oh, does it make better calls?\u0026rdquo;\nSALES REP: \u0026ldquo;No, not at all.

You can make calls in places where Model B doesn\u0026rsquo;t work at all.\u0026rdquo;\nCUSTOMER 1: \u0026ldquo;Then why does Model B have a different antenna?\u0026rdquo;\nSALES REP: \u0026ldquo;Well, if you hook them up to fancy machines and measure something called dbm, Model A\u0026rsquo;s dbm number goes down more than Model B\u0026rsquo;s when you touch the phone in certain places or squeeze it tightly…\u0026rdquo;\nCUSTOMER 1: \u0026ldquo;So if you, like, touch Model A it won\u0026rsquo;t make calls?\u0026rdquo;\nSALES REP: \u0026ldquo;Oh no, not at all. Model A has better coverage in most circumstances because of the better antenna design. Most people find it more reliable. In some isolated cases, the antenna design may lead to a loss of signal for some users in some locations when held in certain ways. This is very rare, and if it is a problem for you, simply wrapping it in a case clears it up completely.\u0026rdquo;\nCUSTOMER 2: \u0026ldquo;You are misleading him. Model A\u0026rsquo;s antenna is so bad that Consumer Reports can\u0026rsquo;t recommend the phone. They say it has a fatal antenna design problem.\u0026rdquo;\nCUSTOMER 1: \u0026ldquo;I think you\u0026rsquo;re confused. The reason I\u0026rsquo;m here is that Consumer Reports rated Model A the best smartphone available. They said it has very good call quality and reliability.\u0026rdquo;\nCUSTOMER 2: \u0026ldquo;No no. That was on Monday. But on Tuesday the clarified that it is totally unusable as a phone.\u0026rdquo;\nCUSTOMER 1: \u0026ldquo;So which one is it? Are they lying?\u0026rdquo;\nSALES REP: \u0026ldquo;No, they aren\u0026rsquo;t lying at all. It just depends which is more important to you. If you are concerned with call quality and reliability, Model A is probably the best bet, possibly with an additional case. If you care a lot about stable dbm, then you should go for Model B. Consumer Reports is perfectly clear: Call quality is better in Model A, the dbm thing is more stable in Model B.\u0026rdquo;\nCUSTOMER 2: \u0026ldquo;Wait, why would I care about dbm. I don\u0026rsquo;t even know what that means.\u0026rdquo;\nSALES REP: \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll have to ask Consumer Reports.\u0026rdquo;\nCUSTOMER 1: \u0026ldquo;So you\u0026rsquo;re saying I need to buy a case in order for Model A to work properly?\u0026rdquo;\nSALES REP: \u0026ldquo;Not at all. The Model A antenna design improves quality and reliability, but at the expense of increased attenuation. In a vast majority of situations, it works better than Model B even without a case. But we have heard of some unusual circumstances where it may perform a little worse. This means depending on where you live or work, where you use your phone, and how you hold it, it may be beneficial in some situations to get a case for the best performance.\u0026rdquo;\nCUSTOMER 1: \u0026ldquo;So you\u0026rsquo;re saying I really should buy a case if I want it to work as well as possible.\u0026rdquo;\nSALES REP: \u0026ldquo;I see your point. Even though it is better over all, it is frustrating that an add-on improves it in the weak places. I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you what. If you buy Model A, I\u0026rsquo;ll give you a free case. We have several options to pick from. That way, if it happens to be a problem for you, you\u0026rsquo;ll have a case. Also, don\u0026rsquo;t forget you can always return the phone for a refund within 30 days. In fact, since people seem to be very worried about the new antenna design, we\u0026rsquo;ll let you return it no questions asked with no restocking fee. So feel free to try it out. We think you will love it. Of course if you prefer, you can buy Model B.\u0026rdquo;\nCUSTOMER 2: \u0026ldquo;Oh, that is great. Consumer Reports said before they could recommend the phone, you would have to change the antenna or give out free cases. So that takes care of their only concern.

But new users shouldn\u0026rsquo;t lose sight of the fact that FileMaker is designed to be as easy as it is powerful. Like anything new, there\u0026rsquo;s a learning curve, but an untrained user can be more productive more quickly in FileMaker than in any other database program around. In this article you\u0026rsquo;ll learn how to build a simple FileMaker database from scratch. You\u0026rsquo;ll start the way the pros do, by analyzing your problem and making a few important decisions. Then you\u0026rsquo;ll dive in and build a database that really works.\nUnderstand the Problem You wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be building a database if you didn\u0026rsquo;t have some kind of problem. Maybe you need to keep track of the work you do so you can be sure you get paid. Or maybe you\u0026rsquo;re planning a wedding and you don\u0026rsquo;t want to lose track of what\u0026rsquo;s done and what\u0026rsquo;s left to do. The real power of a developer tool like FileMaker is that you can solve just about any kind of problem. FileMaker Pro provides the foundation upon which you can build the tools you need to track more accurately, work more efficiently, and report more thoroughly.\nBut before you create your first field, before you design your first layout, you need to really understand your problem. If you don\u0026rsquo;t, you\u0026rsquo;ll inevitably end up building the wrong solution. Then, in a few months when you figure out what you really need, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to start all over again. And so, the first part of any FileMaker development project is to analyze the problem.\nProfessional FileMaker developers ask a lot of questions as they try to understand what their customers need. If you\u0026rsquo;re building a database for yourself, you should be asking questions too:\nWhat kind of information am I keeping track of? What do I need to know about these things? How will I use the information? Will I perform calculations, calculate scores, or analyze data? Am I building a reference I\u0026rsquo;ll refer to time and time again? Where does the information come from? Will I be importing data from another system? Will I be typing the data in directly? Will other people be using my database too? As you think about these questions, take notes. Be especially aware of the nouns — the things you mention as you think about what you want to keep track of. If you\u0026rsquo;ll be importing data from another system, analyze that system (or the export file you get). Find out what kinds of data it includes. You cannot possibly arm yourself with too much information.\nProblem: Recruiting a New Employee Imaging you are a small business owner (if you\u0026rsquo;re using FileMaker, there\u0026rsquo;s a decent chance you are). You have decided it\u0026rsquo;s time to add a new employee. If you\u0026rsquo;re like a lot of people, this is a major problem: finding and recruiting the right person is time consuming. It involves a lot of information. And it is exceptionally important that you do a good job.\nYou know you\u0026rsquo;ll go through 20 or more candidates before you make your final choice, and you know you\u0026rsquo;ll do the same thing all over again when the time comes to grow a little more. So you decide you\u0026rsquo;ll use FileMaker to help streamline the process.\nThis is where the questions come in. What are you keeping track of? Candidates. What do you want to know about them? It might help to make a list:\nresume goals salary expectations relevant work experience interview dates and notes decisions (call? interview? offer a job?) You know you\u0026rsquo;ll use this database as a reference. When, after a well-deserved weekend of rest, you need to schedule follow-up interviews, you need to remember who\u0026rsquo;s who.\nFinally, you realize most of the data will be manually keyed in. But the resume will be supplied by the candidate, and it should be stored in the database too.\nBuilding the Tables and Fields Once you\u0026rsquo;ve asked the right questions, you\u0026rsquo;re ready to build the core of your database. A lot of people find this part nerve-wracking. But you can rest easy. You\u0026rsquo;ve done your homework, and FileMaker is quite forgiving. If you need to make changes later (after you\u0026rsquo;ve added a few candidates and done a few interviews) you can. As long as your core assumptions are sound, your database can grow with your needs for many years.\nThe simplest databases have only one table. In other words, they store information about one thing — Candidates in this case. You can add as many fields as you want to that table. Each field holds one particular attribute about a candidate, like their name, phone number, or the notes you take during the interview. So your first decision is what fields you need in your table. There\u0026rsquo;s no need to write things down at this point. FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s friendly interface is a great place to brain storm your fields, and tweak until you get things just the way you want.\nLaunch FileMaker Pro and choose File → New Database.\nIf you see the FileMaker Quick Start window, choose \u0026ldquo;Create an empty database\u0026rdquo; and then click OK. You will then be asked where to save your database and what to call it. But depending on how FileMaker is configured, you might skip right to the naming and saving part. Name your database\nFileMaker creates your database file where you said to, and shows you Manage Database window (Figure 1). Figure 1In the Manage Database window, you create tables, fields, and relationships, and set various field options. You can return to this dialog box any time by choosing File → Manage → Database.\nAny time you set out to add a field, you need to pick a field type. FileMaker offers several field types, most of which are self-explanatory:\nChoose \u0026ldquo;Text\u0026rdquo; for fields that hold any kind of text value, like a name, a note, or a product description.\nChoose \u0026ldquo;Number\u0026rdquo; for fields that hold plain numbers, like a price, quantity, age, or size. Bear in mind, though, that just because something is called a number doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily mean it is one. For instance, a phone number isn\u0026rsquo;t a simple number, so you should use a Text field for phone numbers. Zip or postal codes are another source of confusion. Since they have leading zeros, and sometimes punctuation or spaces, they are text values too. Only use the Number type when you have a single, simple number.\nChoose \u0026ldquo;Date\u0026rdquo; if you want to store a date, like a birthdate, or the date an order was placed.\nChoose \u0026ldquo;Time\u0026rdquo; to record the time of day, like the time a measurement was taken, or an elapsed time, like how long it took to finish a task.\nChoose \u0026ldquo;Timestamp\u0026rdquo; to record both a date and a time. Timestamps are easier to work with than separate date and time fields if you are really recording the exact date and time something happened, like an appointment, or the moment a record was created.\nChoose \u0026ldquo;Container\u0026rdquo; to store a document or picture, like a person\u0026rsquo;s resume, the draft of an article, or an employee photo.\nTo get started, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a place to record each candidate\u0026rsquo;s name, so you should add a First Name field and a Last Name field. (See the sidebar Choosing Fields for details).\nChoosing Fields One of the trickiest tasks for new FileMaker developers is deciding exactly which fields to create. For instance, should you add a field called Name, or two fields for first and last name? Should you add one Notes field, or separate fields for notes on qualifications, communication skills, and hiring recommendations?\nThe first answer is \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s up to you.\u0026rdquo; You are the one who will use this database, and only you know for sure what you plan to do with it. But it can be hard to know what choices to make if you\u0026rsquo;re not an experienced FileMaker developer. Here are some points to keep in mind:\nWhen deciding between two fields vs. one field, bear in mind that it is always easier to put two values together than it is to take them apart. For instance, if you have just a Name field, and for some reason you need a list of last names, you\u0026rsquo;ll be out of luck. So if the last name is important to you on its own, you should put it in a field of its own.\nOn the other hand, the more places you have to put things, the more rigid your database becomes. For instance, if you have three notes fields, you might find that none of them is just the right spot for a new piece of information. And later, when you search your notes, you may not know which one to search. Putting all your notes in one place may prove more flexible and easier to use. This is especially true since you are unlikely to need to share the notes with another company or software program.\nTo add your first fields, first make sure you\u0026rsquo;re on the Fields tab in the Manage Database window. This is where FileMaker takes you when you first create your database, so you should be there already.\nEnter \u0026ldquo;First Name\u0026rdquo; in the Field Name box.\nFileMaker uses a \u0026ldquo;describe it then create it\u0026rdquo; model so you need to name your field before you create it. Choose \u0026ldquo;Text\u0026rdquo; from the Type pop-up menu.\nThis is the default so it\u0026rsquo;s probably already selected. Click Create.\nFileMaker adds the \u0026ldquo;First Name\u0026rdquo; field to the field list at the top of the window. FileMaker shows every field in a list. Up to this point, you had no fields, so the list was empty. But once you click Create, your field as added to the list, and your database is officially under way.\nRepeat the steps above to add a second text field, but this time name it \u0026ldquo;Last Name.\u0026rdquo;\nAfter a little more thinking, you decide on a few more fields. You can see all the fields you should add in Figure 2.\nFigure 2This is how your field list will look when you finish adding fields. You can see the name of each field, and its type.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;re finished adding fields, click OK to close the Manage Database window. FileMaker shows you a plain-vanilla database like the one in Figure 3.\nFigure 3FileMaker shows all your fields like this. Already, your database is ready to start receiving data. But most people choose to customize the look of their database first.\nDesigning Layouts Tables and fields are all about the data you store in your database. But FileMaker has a second concept, called Layouts, where you decide how all this data is presented. You can build layouts that show your data in a list view, with many records on the screen at once. You can also build layouts that allow you to focus on a single record, and see lots of detail like scrollable blocks of text, and even on-screen buttons. You also use layouts to build printable reports. In fact, although you start out adding fields and tables, you\u0026rsquo;ll spend most of your FileMaker energy working on layouts.\nThe database you just created already has one layout, called Hiring (FileMaker named it after your database). To edit this layout, choose View → Layout Mode. When you switch to Layout mode, FileMaker adds new tools, menus, and on-screen indicators to help you design your database\u0026rsquo;s look and feel. In fact, if you\u0026rsquo;ve ever used a drawing program on your computer, FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s Layout mode should feel very familiar:\nTo move something (like a field or its label) just click and drag with your mouse. You can put anything anywhere you want. To resize something, first click to select it, then drag one of its corners (FileMaker puts little black \u0026ldquo;handles\u0026rdquo; on each corner to help you find the spot). You can make fields wider or narrower, and taller or shorter. To change fonts, colors, borders, and so on, select an item, then visit the Format menu. You can turn your fields blue, or change the text to the font of your choosing. Using these skills, re-arrange the fields on your layout to match Figure 4. This version has the extra space for the Notes field, and a more organized arrangement. While you\u0026rsquo;re at it, select each field (you can Shift-click to select them all at once) and turn on field borders by choosing Format → Field/Control → Borders.\nFigure 4After a little rearranging, your database starts to look more like something you would want to use. If you\u0026rsquo;re the artistic type, feel free to add color, lines and shapes, or even paste in pictures, icons, and other embellishments. The layout is your canvas.\nMost database have at least two layouts: A detail layout like the one you just finished shows lots of information about one record. You\u0026rsquo;ll almost certainly want a list layout too, so you can quickly scroll through your candidates and find the one you\u0026rsquo;re looking for.\nTo make a new layout, choose Layout → New Layout/Report. FileMaker shows the New Layout/Report dialog box, which takes you through a multi-step question and answer process to help streamline the process. For this task, name your layout \u0026ldquo;List\u0026rdquo; and choose the \u0026ldquo;Blank Layout\u0026rdquo; option so you can build your new layout from scratch.\nWhen you click Finish, you see your new, empty layout on the screen.\nFirst you need to add fields to the layout. You get to decide which fields you want to see in your list. For this database, you\u0026rsquo;ll add the First Name, Last Name, Phone Number, and Email Address fields to the layout. Choose Insert → Field, select the First Name field from the list that appears, then click OK. FileMaker adds the First Name field to your layout, ready for you to drag in to place. (You can also add a field by dragging the Field tool from the Status toolbar. It acts like a pad of post-it notes: drag to get a new field, and drag again to get another.)\nRepeat this process to add the Last Name, Phone Number, and Email Address fields. Then arrange these fields in order from left to right on the layout, forming one row. Position them directly below the dotted line labeled Header on the layout. Put the field labels above the fields (and above the dotted line).\nFileMaker layouts are divided into Parts. In Figure 4, you can see three parts on the layout: Header, Body, and Footer. You control how big each of these parts is (and you can add additional specialized part types or edit the parts by choosing Layout → Part Setup.) Each part type has a special (and pretty self-explanatory) purpose for a list-type layout.\nThe Header part shows at the top of the layout, above all the records. The Body part represents one record. When you view your layout as a list, you\u0026rsquo;ll see one copy of this part for every record. The Footer part shows at the bottom of the layout, below all the records. With this in mind, you can imagine that a layout designed for a list display will typically have a small Body. To resize the Body on your new layout, just click and drag the Body part label straight up so that the Body is just big enough to hold the fields. You can see the result in Figure 5.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve created this layout, you need to tell FileMaker to show it in List view. Switch to Browse mode (View → Browse Mode) and then choose View → View as List.\nFigure 5This is a layout designed for List view. It is short, so several records fit on the screen at once.\nNow that you have two layouts, you can switch between them freely. While in Browse mode (View → Browse Mode) you can use the Layout pop-up menu (just below the toolbar) to choose which layout you want to see.\nUsing your Database Believe it or now, you now have a working database. Ready to take it for a spin?\nRegardless of the structure of your database, a few key concepts are always the same. First, you create, edit, and delete records (one record for each candidate, in this case). Making a new record is easy. Choose Records → New Record. On screen, every field becomes empty, making new space to enter information about a new candidate.\nMost of the fields are easy to work with: Just click and start typing. The Resume field, though, requires a little explanation. You don\u0026rsquo;t type into this field because it is a Container field, designed to hold a document like the PDF or Word version of the candidates resume. To add a file to this field, first click into the field (not much will happen on the screen, but the field will have a more solid border than all the others). Then choose Insert → File. FileMaker asks you which file you want to store. Once you pick a file, you\u0026rsquo;ll see its name and icon in the field.\nLater, when you want to view the resume, you can save it back to your hard drive. Again, click on the field, then choose Exit → Export Field Contents. FileMaker asks you where to put the file. It also offers to \u0026ldquo;Automatically open file.\u0026rdquo; If you turn this on, FileMaker will open the copy of the file it creates so you can see it easily.\nFinally, if you want to get rid of a resume, click in the field and press the Delete or Backspace key on your keyboard.\nTo see the records you\u0026rsquo;ve already created, click the Book icon in the status toolbar. It lets you flip to the next or previous record. In this way you can flip through your records to find the one you\u0026rsquo;re looking for. You can also switch to your List layout, where you can scroll through all the people in your database. If you want to see details about a person, first click on them in the list. You\u0026rsquo;ll see a black line along the left edge of that record, indicating it is selected. If you now switch to your detail layout, that\u0026rsquo;s the record you\u0026rsquo;ll see.\nOf course flipping or scrolling through records will only get you so far. Some databases have hundreds, thousands, or even hundreds-of-thousands of records. And even with only a few dozen records, it can be tedious to find just what you want. To help you on your way, FileMaker has Find mode. To get there, choose View → Find Mode. You can tell you\u0026rsquo;re in Find mode because every field has a little magnifying glass in it. In this mode, you don\u0026rsquo;t enter or edit data. Instead, you tell FileMaker what you\u0026rsquo;re looking for, and ask it to find all the matching records. For instance, if you put \u0026ldquo;Bill\u0026rdquo; in the First Name field, and then press Enter, FileMaker shows you all the records for people named Bill. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve performed a find, you have a found set, which is a subset of the records in your database. You can flip through them or scroll through them, but you\u0026rsquo;ll only see the matches.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;re done working with a found set, choose Records → Show All Records to see all your records again.\nWhere You Go from Here You\u0026rsquo;ve only just scratched the surface of FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s tools and capabilities. From here, you might want to speed up data entry by asking FileMaker to \u0026ldquo;auto-enter\u0026rdquo; data in some fields for you, and by using specialized field controls like checkboxes, pop-up menus, and calendar pop-ups. For an even bigger productivity-boost, you can automate common tasks with scripts and buttons. You also might want to print labels, envelopes, or custom reports directly from your database. Finally, you may want to add more tables and track more of your business in your database. To take advantage of these techniques you\u0026rsquo;ve got more learning to do. But hopefully you can now see how easy, fun, and productive the process can be.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/advisor/getting-started-with-filemaker-pro/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Getting Started with FileMaker Pro"},{"content":"FileMaker Pro 10 introduced an assortment of exciting new features but the king of the hill, so to speak, is Script Triggers. You could argue that this is the biggest new feature to hit FileMaker since version 7 back in the late Cretaceous period. Alas, it is also one of the most complex features you\u0026rsquo;ll encounter as a budding FileMaker developer. But that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean less advanced developers should ignore these triggers all together. With a little guidance, you can put script triggers to use in almost any database, and start making FileMaker do things it never could before.\nScript Triggers Explained A script trigger is, simply put, a way to tell FileMaker to run your script under some predetermined circumstance. In some sense FileMaker has always had this power. After all, you probably already know you can turn a layout object into a button. You\u0026rsquo;re telling FileMaker to run a particular script whenever the button is clicked. If you pop in to the File → File Options dialog box, you can also configure a script to run when the file is first opened and another when it is closed. All of these have been around for ages, and they\u0026rsquo;re all small examples of script triggers.\nBut 10 takes this to a new level by allowing you to trigger scripts under a dozen new situations. You can kick off a script whenever someone switches to a particular layout, or when they tab in to a field. Your scripts can jump in to action when your users switch tabs in a tab control, commit a record, or switch to Find mode. All these trigger points spell flexibility for you, the developer.\nDo you have a report layout that should find and sort a particular way? Why make your users run a script when they can just switch to the layout. With a simple script trigger, you can make sure they always get the right data. Do you need a tab order that\u0026rsquo;s more complex than FileMaker lets you define? Maybe you want to skip right past the \u0026ldquo;Have you ever been pregnant\u0026rdquo; drop-down list if the patient is very young. Or tab in to the Date and Time fields only when the \u0026ldquo;Schedule Delivery\u0026rdquo; checkbox is turned on. These kinds of things were difficult-to-impossible in FileMaker 9 because once your user started working with the database, your scripts had very little control. Now you can sprinkle your layouts with a little magic script trigger dust, and inject control exactly where you need it. Truly, the sky\u0026rsquo;s the limit with this feature.\nAdding Script Triggers to your Database Script triggers are applied at two levels. First, you can attach a trigger to an entire layout. Alternately, you can attach a trigger to a particular layout object (like a field, portal, or tab control).\nFileMaker 10 has seven layout-centric script triggers in all. Each trigger has a nerdy-sounding name that tells you a little about when it will fire. The layout script triggers are:\nOnRecordLoad. This trigger kicks in whenever a new record is \u0026ldquo;loaded.\u0026rdquo; In other words, when the user switches to a different record by clicking the book icon, performing a find, omitting the current record, and so forth. Whatever the method, when the record appears, your script runs. OnRecordCommit. No matter how they do it, if your user commits a record, this trigger will run your script. The user can click out of the record, press Enter, switch to a different record, change layouts, or even quit FileMaker. In every case, your script will run if there are record changes to commit. OnRecoreRevert. This trigger fires when you revert a record. (You can do this with the Records → Revert Record menu command or the Revert Record script step.) OnLayoutKeystroke. Both complex and exceptionally powerful, the OnLayoutKeystroke trigger fires every time a key is pressed on the keyboard. Want to delete the record when someone presses the \u0026ldquo;D\u0026rdquo; key? Didn\u0026rsquo;t think so, but if you did, you could do it with this trigger. OnLayoutLoad. Whenever your user switches to the layout, this trigger runs your script. OnModeEnter. This trigger runs your script when the user switches to browse mode, find mode, and/or preview mode. OnModeExit. While OnModeEnter fires when you first switch to a mode, this trigger fires right before you leave a mode. For layout objects, you can pick from five script triggers:\nOnObjectEnter. This trigger fires when a field has been entered, a button or tab has been tabbed to, or a portal row has become active. It also fires when you click on the page in a web viewer, or tab to a field on the web page. OnObjectKeystroke. Just like OnLayoutKeystroke, this trigger fires when you press a key on the keyboard. This time, though, it only runs when you press keys while the object has focus. In other words, when you’re clicked into a field, or a button or tab control has the thick black border you see when you tab to it. OnObjectModify. This trigger is sort of a catch all. Its behavior depends entirely on what kind of object you attach it to. For fields, it triggers whenever you’re in the field and change its value in any way (by typing, deleting, pasting, cutting, and so forth). Many times, if you think you want an OnObjectKeystroke trigger, you really want an OnObjectModify trigger instead. For instance, OnObjectModify doesn’t fire when you use the arrow keys to move around in a field, or when you tab to another field. OnObjectKeystroke does fire in these situations, making it more powerful, but also much more difficult to work with. Finally, OnObjectModify also fires for tab controls when you switch from one tab to another. OnObjectSave. When you make changes to a field (you can type, delete, cut and paste, and otherwise mangle the field’s data to your heart’s content) and then leave the field, this trigger kicks in. It only fires if the field was actually modified, and (unlike OnObjectModify) only when the user is done editing and leaves the field. OnObjectExit. This trigger works just like OnObjectEnter, except it fires when you leave the object instead of when you go to it. Unlike OnObjectSave, it fires even if the field wasn’t changed in any way. To assign a trigger to a layout, just visit the Layout → Layout Setup dialog box and switch to the Script Triggers tab (Figure 1).\nFigure 1The Layout Setup dialog box (Layout → Layout Setup) has a new Script Triggers tab. Just turn on the trigger you want, then choose the script you want to run. For most triggers, you also get to decide which modes it works in. For example, you could set your OnModeEnter trigger to run in Find mode only, and it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t fire when you switch to any other mode.\nAssigning a layout object trigger is almost as easy. First, select the object with which you want to associated the trigger. Then choose Format → Set Script Triggers. Once again, you can turn on any trigger, then pick an associated script.\nA Simple Example Suppose you run a delivery service, and you use a FileMaker database to track your upcoming deliveries. When you view your \u0026ldquo;Delivery List\u0026rdquo; layout, you always sort it descending by time, so the oldest deliveries are at the top, and top priority. Of course you can just sort the list each time you visit it, but that gets old fast. In FileMaker 9, the best alternative was to write a script that goes to the layout and sorts the records. You could then put a button somewhere to run this script, show it in the Scripts menu, or use Custom Menus to add it to some other menu.\nThis method works fairly well, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t perfect. You either have to script access to every layout, which is time consuming, or you have to remember that this layout is special, and get to it in a different way.\nIn FileMaker 10, you can use script triggers to tell FileMaker you want to run a script every time you go to this layout. When you do this, your users have nothing new to learn. They just switch to the layout the same way they always did (and the same way they do with every other layout). And best of all, it is easy to implement:\nCreate a script with just one line: Sort Records. Configure it to sort however you like.\nYour script is now available to select when configuring script triggers. Go to the list layout and switch to Layout mode. Then, from the Layout menu, choose Layout Setup.\nYou see the Layout Setup dialog box. Switch to the Script Triggers tab.\nYou see the list of available script triggers. Each has a checkbox by its name. Turn on the checkbox next to OnLayoutLoad.\nAt the bottom of the window, you now see a Specify button and other configuration options. In the Specify Script window, select the script you created in step 1, then click OK.\nFileMaker now shows your script name associated with this script trigger. Click OK to close the Layout Setup window and switch back to Browse mode.\nNothing looks different but now your script will run automatically every time you or your users visit this layout. That\u0026rsquo;s it. Now whenever you switch to this layout, FileMaker will sort the records for you. Easy as pie.\nKeystroke Triggers Suppose your database has a Delivery Scheduled checkbox, and an associated When field. The idea here is that you can schedule deliver for a certain date. As you tab through the layout, doing data entry, if you don\u0026rsquo;t turn on the Delivery Scheduled checkbox, there\u0026rsquo;s no need to enter a date. For the sake of maximum data entry efficiency, you would like the Tab key to skip right past the When field if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be filled in. You can see a database like this in Figure 2.\nFigure 2In this database, there\u0026rsquo;s no need to tab to the When field if you haven\u0026rsquo;t turned on the Delivery Scheduled checkbox.\nYou could use this same technique in other database systems too, of course. For instance, you might have questions that are age specific in your patient database, or type specific in your product database.\nTo solve this problem you\u0026rsquo;ll call upon the OnObjectKeystroke trigger. This is, without a doubt, the most complex of FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s trigger types. Of course attaching an OnObjectKeystroke trigger to your checkbox field is a breeze. And you can probably guess what you want your script to do:\nIf the checkbox is turned on and the user pressed Tab, go to the When field. Otherwise, skip to the price field.\nThe first challenge is figuring out which key the user pressed. Your script will be called when they press any key at all. You certainly don\u0026rsquo;t want to be bouncing from field to field if they press the letter A or the space bar. The secret is the new Get(TriggerKeystroke) function. When a script runs because of a keystroke trigger, this function tells you which key the user pressed. For instance, if the user presses the letter A, then Get(TriggerKeystroke) returns \u0026quot;A\u0026quot;.\nBut the Tab key is a little trickier still. After all, it is hard to type a Tab into a FileMaker calculation. To make these hard-to-reach characters easier to work with, FileMaker assigns a special number to each key. It just so happens that the Tab key is number 9. The Code function turns any value into its special number code. So a calculation like this will tell you if the tab key was pressed:\nCode(Get(TriggerKeystroke)) = 9 You can find a complete list of codes for special keys in the FileMaker help. Just search for \u0026ldquo;Code.\u0026rdquo;\nThe script in Figure 3 uses this calculation to control where the user goes when they press the Tab key. Unfortunately, if you run this script from an OnObjectKeystroke trigger attached to the Delivery Scheduled checkbox, you\u0026rsquo;ll quickly discover it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work properly.\nFigure 3This script is designed to be used with a keystroke trigger. It checks the code of the key the user pressed. If it is 9 (the Tab key) then it takes action, navigating the user to the correct field.\nYou were warned: keystroke triggers are tricky. This script has two problems. You\u0026rsquo;ll spot the first right away: No matter how you set the checkbox, you end up on the wrong field. The problem is simple but subtle. When you press the Tab key, your script runs, putting the user in the right field. Then, after the script finishes, FileMaker processes the Tab key, taking the user to the next field in the tab order. Clearly when your script does its thing, you don\u0026rsquo;t want FileMaker to see the Tab as well. Luckily, this is easy to fix. Many script triggers allow you script to \u0026ldquo;cancel\u0026rdquo; the original trigger action, and OnObjectKeystroke is one of them. (See the sidebar \u0026ldquo;Cancel an Event\u0026rdquo; for more on this power.)\nCancel an Event Several of FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s script triggers can be \u0026ldquo;canceled.\u0026rdquo; This means you get even more power to control how things work. The script you write can control whether or not the original action that caused the trigger to fire should continue or not. For example, if you configure an OnRecordCommit trigger, your script can tell FileMaker to cancel the commit. If it does, once your trigger script finished running, the record will still be uncommitted. In this way, you can use some script logic to check some criteria, and refuse to allow the user to commit the record until your script is satisfied.\nThis feature is very powerful. If your script tells FileMaker to cancel an operation, it will do so without question. If the user tries to switch layouts, but your script cancels the commit, then they layout won\u0026rsquo;t change. In fact, the user can even try to quit FileMaker. Still, it won\u0026rsquo;t happen until your script allows it. This give you unprecedented control over how your users interact with your database. (And of course with great power comes great responsibility. You need to think through many outcomes to avoid getting your users stuck.)\nThe following triggers are cancelable:\nOnRecordCommit OnRecordRevert OnLayoutKeystroke OnModeExit OnObjectKeystroke OnObjectSave OnObjectExit The secret to canceling is the Exit Script script step. This step lets you specify a calculated \u0026ldquo;result\u0026rdquo; which is a single value the script sends back to whoever called it. In the case of a script trigger, FileMaker called you script, and it checks this result to see if the action should be canceled. To cancel an action, add a step like this at the end of your script:\nExit Script [ False ] When the script exits with a False result the event is canceled.\nAll you need to do is add an Exit Script script step to the end of your script. Be sure to click its Specify Result button and put 0 or False in the result calculation. This tells FileMaker to ignore the keystroke after you\u0026rsquo;re done with it.\nNow your script is almost perfect. The last problem requires a little testing. When you press Tab, FileMaker goes to the next field in the tab order. But if you press Shift-Tab, it goes to the previous field instead. For the sake of simplicity, you can just tell your script to ignore Tab keystrokes when the Shift key is down. You detect this with the Get(TriggerModifierKeys) function. This function returns secret codes of its own:\nShift: 1 Caps Lock: 2 Ctrl or Control: 4 Alt or Option: 8 Since you can hold more than one modifier key down at the same time, FileMaker adds up the numbers associated with each key and gives you back the total. For instance, if you have Caps Lock and Shift down, then the result of Get(TriggerModifierKeys) will be 3 (1 for Shift plus 2 for Caps Lock).\nIn your case, you only want your script to operate if there are no modifier keys down, or if only the Caps Lock key is down. To make the change, modify the If step\u0026rsquo;s condition formula to look like this:\nCode( Get ( TriggerKeystroke ) ) = 9 and (Get (TriggerModifierKeys) = 0 or Get(TriggerModifierKeys) = 2) This version will only do its magic if the Get(TriggerModifierKeys) function returns 0 (no modifiers) or 2 (Caps Lock).\nWith this change in place, your script trigger does its magic. As you tab through the fields on the layout, FileMaker dutifully skips the When field unless it matters.\nThe Sky\u0026rsquo;s the Limit The true power of script triggers goes well beyond making it a little easier to do what you could do before, or making slight improvements to data entry. With script triggers you can do things that simply weren\u0026rsquo;t possible in FileMaker 9. This is a true developer\u0026rsquo;s feature — a new tool you can use creatively to help solve complex problems. It is impossible for one article to tell you all you can do with Script Triggers. Hopefully, though, with the mechanics under your belt, and a little experimentation, you can put this power feature to use for you.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/advisor/practical-script-triggers/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Practical Script Triggers"},{"content":"FileMaker 10’s new Script Triggers feature just keeps delivering. You might, at first, think triggers are limited to layouts and fields, but it turns out your triggers can fire with all kinds of objects. In this article we’ll show you how to run scripts when users switch tabs on your tab controls. In the end, we’ll also revisit a common FileMaker problem: tabs switch when you switch layouts. We’ll show you how to solve this problem quickly and easily using script triggers.\nTriggers with Tabs It is unfortunately not entirely obvious, but Script Triggers work with tab controls. Specifically:\nThe OnObjectModify trigger fires whenever the user switches to a different tab. This is probably the most useful trigger for tab controls.\nThe OnObjectEnter trigger fires when the tab control gets keyboard focus. This happens when it is in the tab order and you tab to it (so a tab gets the thick black border). You can see a tab control with keyboard focus here:\nIn FileMaker you can tab (the key) into a tab (the user interface element). When you do, it looks like this.\nThe OnObjectExit trigger fires when the tab control loses focus. In other words, when you tab away from it.\nThe OnObjectKeystroke trigger fires when the tab control has focus and you press any key on the keyboard.\nWatching the Tab Change Once you know all that, keeping tabs on your tabs (sorry) is easy. For example, suppose you want to show a special message under some circumstances when someone switches to a particular tab. Setting this up couldn’t be easier:\nWrite a script that does what you want.\nFor example, it might show a dialog box, calculate a total, set a global, or clear a selection. In Layout mode, select your tab control, then choose Format → Set Script Triggers…\nThe Set Script Triggers dialog box appears. Turn on the OnObjectModify checkbox.\nYou’ve just told FileMaker you want to run a script, so it asks you which script to run. Select the script you created in step 1.\nWhen you’re done here, click OK, then switch to Browse mode. You’re ready to test. As this video attests, your script now runs as soon as the user switches to any tab:\nFileMaker can now run scripts whenever a tab control switches tabs. And scripts can, as always, do a lot of stuff.\nWhich Tab If you watched the video closely, you may have noticed that the scripted dialog box showed which tab was selected. With only one trigger script, how do you manage this? You just have to ask.\nFileMaker’s esoteric GetLayoutObjectAttribute function can tell you all kinds of information about objects on your layout. Of particular interest, it can tell you if a tab panel is front most. To use it, though, you first need to give your tabs object names. We’ve showed you how to do this before but here’s a quick refresher. If you’re already an object names expert, you can skip ahead.\nIn Layout mode, click on your tab control to select it.\nWhen you click, the first tab gets a thick black border. This tells you that specific tab panel is selected. (You can have an entire tab control selected, without selecting any of its individual panels. You’ll see this in a moment.) Choose View → Object Info to show the Object Info palette.\nThis is where you go to set object names (among other things). Since its a palette, you can simply leave it open while you work through all your tabs. In the Object Name box in the Object Info palette, type a unique and identifying name for your tab.\nYou might call it “tab1” or “customer tab” or whatever you feel is appropriate. Click the second tab in your tab control.\nThe second tab comes to the front but it is not selected. Notice it doesn’t have a thick border. Click once again on the second tab.\nThis time it gets its thick border. This is important. You can only name a tab panel once you have it properly selected. Give this tab a unique name, then repeat these steps to name every tab in your tab control.\nIf you want to find out if a particular tab panel is in the front, it must have a name, so you’re best of naming them all. Once you’ve given every tab panel a name, you’re ready to start asking FileMaker who’s in front. This part is easy. Here’s the long-but-simple formula to see if a tab is in front:\nGetLayoutObjectAttribute ( “myTab”, “isFrontTabPanel” ) Notice that this formula only looks at one particular tab panel (in this case it is looking at the panel called myTab so be sure to put one of your tab panel object names there instead). It will return a True result if the tab panel is in front, and a False result otherwise. To determine which of all the tabs is in front, you can check them one by one:\nCase( GetLayoutObjectAttribute ( “myFirstTab”, “isFrontTabPanel” ); “First tab is in front”; GetLayoutObjectAttribute ( “mySecondTab”, “isFrontTabPanel” ); “Second tab is in front”; GetLayoutObjectAttribute ( “myThirdtTab”, “isFrontTabPanel” ); “Third tab is in front” ) Or, in a script:\nIf [ GetLayoutObjectAttribute(“myFirstTab”, “isFrontTabPanel”) ] # do stuff for the first tab Else If [ GetLayoutObjectAttribute ( “mySecondTab”, “isFrontTabPanel” ) ] # do stuff for the second tab Else If [ GetLayoutObjectAttribute ( “myThirdtTab”, “isFrontTabPanel” ) ] # do stuff for the third tab End If Restoring Tab State Now that you know how to watch for tab changes, and figure out which tab is in front, you can take it one step further, and solve an age-old FileMaker problem in the process. Last year, we wrote up a laborious technique to remember which tab is in front before you leave a layout, then bring it back to the front when you come back. This way, if your scripts have to quickly zip to another layout to get some work done, your users don’t get distracted by tab controls that keep switching back to the first tab.\nThat technique worked, but it was tedious. You had to write two long and complicated scripts. Then you had to call one every time you leave the layout, and the other every time you come back. What a nuisance.\nUsing Script Triggers, you can save all the hassle. Now two very simple scripts can get the job done, and they can do it automatically every time you return to the layout.\nNote: In fact, this new, simpler version is even better than the old way. The tab will restore itself even if you manually leave the layout and come back later, making things a touch more stable for your users. First, you need a simple script to remember the front most tab:\nSet Variable [ $$FRONT_TAB; Case( GetLayoutObjectAttribute(“myFirstTab”, “isFrontTabPanel” ; “myFirstTab”; GetLayoutObjectAttribute(“mySecondTab”, “isFrontTabPanel”); “mySecondTab”; GetLayoutObjectAttribute(“myThirdtTab”, “isFrontTabPanel”); “myThirdtTab” ) ] That’s it (and its really a one line script, although we put it on a few lines here so it would be easier to read. Just set a global variable to the name of the font most tab.\nTip: If you have multiple tab controls to keep track of, make sure you use a unique variable name (or repetition) for each one. Otherwise, changes to one set of tabs will impact the others. Now attach an OnObjectModify trigger to your tab control and set it to run the script. With these two steps complete, a new global variable will always remember which tab you last visited.\nNext, you need to make FileMaker restore the front most tab whenever you come to this layout. This part is equally easy. Start with a simple script:\nIf [ Not IsEmpty($$FRONT_TAB) ] Go to Object [ $$FRONT_TAB ] End If This script first checks to see if the $$FRONT_TAB variable has a value. If it does, it uses the Go to Object step to bring that tab to the front.\nFinally, tell FileMaker to run this script whenever the layout loads. You do this with (shocker) a script trigger. Choose Layout → Layout Setup, then switch to the Script Triggers tab. Turn on the OnLayoutLoad trigger and point it to your script.\nHere’s a video showing the tab behavior with and without the triggers:\nNormally FileMaker resets all tab controls to the first tab when you return to a layout. But with this technique, the user is still \u0026ldquo;on\u0026rdquo; the tab they last used when they come back.\nIn the first version (before the fade-to-black) FileMaker switches back to the firs tab every time you leave the layout and come back. In the second, it seamlessly keeps things in order. This magic works whether your user leaves the layout manually, or you do it with script. Easy as pie.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/sfr/script-triggers-monitoring-and-restoring-tabs/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Script Triggers: Monitoring and Restoring Tabs"},{"content":"FileMaker 10’s most visible new feature is the completely redesigned Status toolbar (formerly called the Status area). Perhaps because of its prominent position, or because it is such a striking departure from a 20-year FileMaker mainstay, this change has been met with its fair share of controversy. In this article we’ll show you why you don’t need to worry, and how you can make the new Status toolbar work for you.\nIn FileMaker 10, the standard Status toolbar looks something like this:\nThe new Status Toolbar is quite a departure from the FileMaker you know and love.\nIf you leave the Status toolbar open, your user will see prominent New Record and Delete Record buttons (among others). At first this might seem nuts. After all, many of you have special buttons on your layouts specifically for record creation and deletion, and you certainly don’t want people willy-nilly switching layouts to the wrong view, confusing themselves in the process. But it turns out you have more control over these buttons than most people realize. You cannot add your own buttons or custom icons, but you can:\nDisable buttons you don’t want your users to click Reconnect most buttons to scripts of your own Rename buttons to better reflect the terminology in your database Note: If you have the equivalent menu commands disabled in your database, then the buttons are already disabled too. A database with locked-down user interface in 9 is just as locked down in 10. Disabling Buttons There are three ways to disable buttons in the Status toolbar (not all apply to all buttons). You can set up custom record privileges to control who can create and delete records. You can restrict access to menu commands using a privilege set; and finally, you can use custom menus to remove troublesome menu commands. Which you use is a matter of your security and user interface needs.\nCustom Record Privileges Using custom record privileges you can remove the ability for a user to create or delete records for any particular table. When you do, the associated status toolbar button will disable as appropriate. This even works for so called “record level access” privileges. For instance, you can remove the ability to delete a record only once its Status field has been set to “shipped.” When you do, the Delete Record button will disable when you view shipped records.\nSetting this up is easy:\nIn your database, choose File → Manage → Accounts and Privileges.\nThe Accounts \u0026amp; Privileges dialog box appears. Open one of your existing privilege sets, or create a new privilege set.\nYou’ll probably need to switch to the Privilege Sets tab. If you’re doing this for the first time, it is probably easiest if you duplicate the [Data Entry Only] privilege set so you start off with some reasonable privileges. From the Records pop-up menu, make a reasonable choice.\nFor example, if you want to remove the ability to delete records of any kind, choose “Create and edit in all tables.” For the ultimate in control, choose “Custom privileges.” This window shows a privilege set configured so users can create records in any table, but can only delete Vendor records. Once you assign an account to this privilege set, when that user logs in, they’ll see the Delete Record button disabled when they look at Customer records:\nThe Delete Record toolbar button is only available if the user is allowed to delete the record.\nRestricted Menu Access The record privileges don’t effect the other toolbar buttons (since they have nothing to do with creating or deleting records). Also, for databases where security isn’t terribly important, and preventing casual or accidental unwanted actions is all you need, restricting record privileges can be heavy handed and hard to script around.\nFor cases like this, the easiest solution is to restrict menu access. If you revisit the Privilege Sets tab of the Manage → Account \u0026amp; Privileges dialog box, you’ll discover that you can make gross restrictions to the menu commands your users get:\nThe easiest way to disable toolbar buttons is to disable the menu commands they\u0026rsquo;re associated with.\nIf you switch to Editing Only or Minimal, FileMaker takes away all the powerful commands (like Import and Export, New Record, Delete Record, Find, and so forth). All the associated Status toolbar buttons will disable as well.\nCustom Menus For the utmost in control, you can turn to Custom Menus. This power feature is only available in FileMaker Pro Advanced, and gives you almost complete control of the menus, sub-menus, and commands your users see when they use your database. You’ll see some step-by-step instructions for using custom menus at the end of this article. For now, it will suffice to say that if you remove a menu command from a menu set, then when that menu set is active, the associated button in the Status toolbar will be disabled. In this way you can selectively disable any button you choose.\nRenaming and Redefining Buttons Disabling buttons is all well and good, if you’re a fan of taunting your users with permanently-out-of-reach temptation [ed: who isn\u0026rsquo;t?!]\n. But why not take it a step further. Embrace those buttons and make them do your dirty work. Taking control of the toolbar buttons requires use of custom menus (and, by extension, FileMaker Pro Advanced).\nImagine you have a database of customers and vendors. Your business rules require that you carefully control the process of creating and deleting records. For instance, you may need to set up web site access for any new customers, which requires running your fancy SQL scripts. Here’s how to express your authority and keep the Status toolbar buttons:\nNote: In this example, you’ll use the “Custom Menu Set 1” menu set FileMaker creates for you. Adjust the steps as necessary if you have your own custom menu sets already. From the File Menu, choose Manage → Custom Menus.\nThe (quite complex) Manage Custom Menus dialog box appears. This is grand central station for every menu command FileMaker can muster. In the Custom Menus tab, select the Records Copy menu.\nFileMaker ships with a customizable copy of all the standard menus to make it easy to squeeze small changes into otherwise-normal menus. This is the copy of the usual Records menu, where the New Record and Delete Record commands live. With the menu selected, click Edit.\nThe Edit Custom Menu dialog box appears. On the left side, you see all the menu items in this menu. Select the New Record menu item.\nWhen you select a menu item, the right side of the dialog box fills in with options for the item. There’s lots of power here, so feel free to explore. You can see the options in the figure below.\nWith Custom Menus you can, among other things, rename FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s standard menu items and assign them to your own scripts.\nLook next to “Command” and make sure it says “New Record.”\nThis is the key to this entire technique. This menu item is associated with the New Record command, which is a core command in FileMaker. When you adjust the behavior of the menu item associated with the New Record command, you also modify the behavior of the New Record toolbar button. Turn on the Action checkbox and select the script you use to create new records.\nWhen you add an action to the menu item, you get to pick either a single step or a script. In most cases you’re best off using a script (even if it is a one-liner) because it makes it easy to change later, even if several different menu sets include items that do the same thing. If you want, turn on the Title checkbox, click its associated Specify button, and enter a calculation to determine the menu title.\nFor instance, you might decide you want your menu called “New Customer,” “Create Record,” or Pi * Random. Ok, probably not the last one, but the point is, you can use all the power of calculations to generate a dynamic and interesting title for your menu. Anything you do here will also influence the label under the New Record button in the Status toolbar. Select the Delete Record menu item and configure as you wish.\nJust make sure you keep Command set to “Delete Record…” so FileMaker knows you’re adjusting behavior for the delete action. Click OK to close the Edit Custom Menu dialog box.\nYou’re now back in the Manage Custom Menus dialog box. From the “Default menu set for this file” pop-up menu, choose “Custom Menu Set 1.”\nWhen you make this change, you’re telling FileMaker you want the customized menu set to be used automatically for this database. You can also configure custom menu sets on a per-layout basis (See the Layouts → Layout Setup dialog box in Layout Mode) or switch menu sets via scripts (using the Install Menu Set script step). Click OK once more to close this dialog box.\nNow you’re ready to test your changes. If all went well, the New Record and Delete Record buttons in the Status toolbar now bend to your will. Dealing With the View As Buttons The steps above show you how to attach your own actions to the New Record and Delete Record toolbar buttons. But at the outset, we also mentioned the potential confusion your users might get by accidentally clicking the View As toolbar buttons. Once again, you have two options here.\nTo disable any of these buttons you can disable a particular view on a per-layout basis. For instance, your Customer List layout only makes sense in List view, so turn off Form and Table views. This is super easy. In Layout mode, choose Layouts → Layout Setup, switch to the Views tab, and uncheck the views you don’t want your users to use. When you do, the associated buttons in the Status toolbar will be disabled.\nTip: You might take this opportunity to disable Table view in many of your layouts, since it has some potentially unwanted power. We discuss this in more detail here. To get these buttons to run your own script, just override the View as Form, View as List, and View as Table commands using custom menus, as described above. You’ll find them in the View Copy menu if you use the built in custom menu set.\nTo Infinity and Beyond Combining the various custom menu techniques, plus some clever naming conventions and scripts, you can get the Status toolbar really working for you. In this video demo, you can see a simple database that customizes the behavior of several toolbar buttons so this standard FileMaker user interface integrates seamlessly with your carefully controlled database.\nThis sample database (available for download here) combines several techniques to fully incorporate the Status Toolbar into a highly customized database experience.\nIn this example (which is anything but fully baked) we use the Get(LayoutName) function and some custom scripting to get the “View as Form” and “View as List” buttons to switch to appropriate layouts. We’ve also added a custom script to the New Record and Delete Record buttons, and renamed them so it is more obvious what they will do.\nThis kind of integration has several powerful advantages:\nFileMaker takes care of a lot of nice user interface work that we would otherwise have to create (and duplicate on every layout) ourselves. That means less time fiddling and more time making databases meet the needs of our customers.\nThis database has more powerful interface elements than it would if we had to handle the UI ourselves. For instance, our end users can show and hide the toolbar at will, and customize it to their needs.\nIf we build multiple databases for the same customer, they all work the same way. If a user customizes the toolbar in one database, their changes will apply in all of them. They only have to learn one set of interactions. This means we get more consistency with less work.\nA lot of people have expressed frustration about the new Status area, complaining that FileMaker has taken away control they need. I hope this article makes it clear that we have more control than ever before.\nAn Opinionated Endnote A lot of the frustration about the Status toolbar seems to stem from the fact that it is now more obvious that you can, for example, delete a record. These commands used to be squirreled away in menus, and now they’re front-and-center. But of course a less visible menu command is just as dangerous in the wrong hands. So the new toolbar, perhaps, has simply made it more obvious to developers that they need to be careful.\nThe reaction to the new prominence of these commands illustrates another interesting reality. Menus have become no-man’s land. More and more in modern, popular applications, the commands you need are readily available in an explorable, friendly busy-box of interface goodness. People expect to see what they can do. I think this phenomenon really underscores the wisdom in the new Status toolbar. To keep current, FileMaker needs to evolve a more modern user interface. It did, and suddenly people notice what FileMaker can do. That is, in my opinion, A Good Thing™. Editorializing over.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/sfr/make-the-status-toolbar-work-for-you/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Make the Status Toolbar Work for You"},{"content":"For years, FileMaker developers have been devising various filter techniques. The idea is that you type all or part of a name, part number, description, etc… and a list of results filters down to show relevant matches. As handy as these techniques are, they always stop just short of perfect because, before FileMaker 10, you had to exit the field before the filter would take effect. Using FileMaker 10’s powerful Script Triggers, you can make the impact of your filtering more immediate.\nWe’ve never done this before, but the idea, scripts, and sample file for this technique come directly from FileMaker luminary and Six Fried Rice reader David Graham of Bit Tailor. We’re publishing it here (with David’s permission) because it is an excellent example of Script Triggers solving an age-old problem in an elegant way. [ed: David’s site seems to no longer exist so I’ve updated the link to point to Web Archive.] There are as many ways to filter lists in FileMaker as there are developers implementing it. The beauty of this technique is that it doesn’t matter if you prefer exploded keys and filtered portals, aggregate text fields and a find, or (my personal favorite) scripted multi-request finds. Whatever you want, when it is fast, clean filtering you’re after, it is always better if the results appear as you type. This sort of thing was essentially impossible with FileMaker 9. Once a user started entering data in a field, you were hands-off until they finished.\nSome people dreamed up horrifying solutions with looping scripts and all manner of wackiness. These techniques, in my opinion, never worked well. Consequently, we were always resigned to the “press Enter when you’re done” model. But when the results appear as you type, the user gets immediate feedback, only needs to go as far as necessary to get the result they want, and doesn’t have to click back into the field to correct or make a change. So it is clearly a better model. See for yourself:\nThis is what we\u0026rsquo;ve always wanted: fast as-you-typ narrowing of results.\nDavid’s technique relies on the handy OnObjectModify trigger on the filter field to kick off a script every time the field changes. This includes:\nWhen you add a single letter to the field by typing a key. When you remove something by pressing Delete or Backspace. When you cut text from the field or paste it in. You may be tempted to use the OnObjectKeystroke trigger for something like this, but OnObjectModify gets you more bang for the buck: It handles cut and paste, and doesn’t require all the complexity of keystroke triggers.\nThe Code I’ll let you explore David’s sample file for the full scoop, but the core of his technique can be found in two places. First, he uses an exploded key filtering technique, which I won’t cover here, except to say that the idea is to process some text data and produce a multi-line key that includes partial match values. In other words, if the value is “Test” then the key would match “T”, “Te”, “Tes” and “Test.” In this way, you can type all-or-part of the value and see the results. Look at David’s ExplodeToMultikey custom function to see how he accomplishes this.\nIf you prefer, you can use scripted finds and a list view layout to do your filtering instead.\nBut the interesting part is this very simple trigger script:\nSet Variable [$currentObject; Get ( ActiveLayoutObjectName )] Commit Records/Requests [] Go to Object [ $currentObject ] Set Selection [ Start: Length (Get(ActiveFieldContents)) + 1] That’s it. This script really just does two things:\nIt commits the record, causing anything you’ve typed in the filter field to take effect. It returns you to the field, so if you type again, your keystrokes will go right on the end of the field. In this way, as you type, your changes reflect immediately. Very cool.\nTip: If you were using finds instead of exploded keys, you would add a a few more steps to your script to switch to Find mode, build a find request or two, and then perform the find. You can download the working file right here.\nThanks to David for the great technique!\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/sfr/script-triggers-filter-as-you-type/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Script Triggers: Filter as you Type"},{"content":"In our article about FileMaker 10, we promised some tips on using the new Set Field by Name script step, which gives FileMaker the power of indirection. This is a complicated concept, and we’ll be posting some real world examples along the way, as well. But first, we’ll give you a full explanation of the new script step and function that make indirection possible.\nSet Field by Name The core of the new feature is the Set Field by Name script step. It works almost just like the Set Field script you know and love. But with Set Field you hard code the field you want to modify. Every time your script runs, the same field is “set.”\nWith Set Field by Name you get to use a calculation to determine not only the value you put in the field, but also which field gets set. An example will help. Imagine you have a database of the T-shirts you sell. Each T-shirt has 5 different prices, depending on the quantity someone orders. Your SHIRTS table, thus, has these five fields:\nPrice 1 Price 2 Price 3 Price 4 Price 5 Now imagine you have a scripted process that updates one of these price fields based on a parameter. For instance, you might call the script and pass a parameter of 3 to update the third price value. Such a script might look like this:\nIf [ #P(“which”) = 1 ] Set Field [ My Table::Price 1; #P(“newPrice”) ] Else If [ #P(“which”) = 2 ] Set Field [ My Table::Price 2; #P(“newPrice”) ] Else If [ #P(“which”) = 3 ] Set Field [ My Table::Price 3; #P(“newPrice”) ] Else If [ #P(“which”) = 4 ] Set Field [ My Table::Price 4; #P(“newPrice”) ] Else If [ #P(“which”) = 5 ] Set Field [ My Table::Price 5; #P(“newPrice”) ] End If Note: The above script uses our custom functions for passing multiple script parameters. You can of course use any method you want. Using Set Field by Name, you can make this script a lot simpler:\nSet Field by Name [ “My Table::Price ” \u0026amp; #P(“which”); #P(newPrice) ] This version of the script gets the same job done with a lot less work. Even better, it is automatically expandable. If you add a sixth price field, you can call this script with a 6 and it will set the new price field automagically.\nNote: That probably bears repeating because it really illustrates the power of indirection. This script, written today, can seamlessly work with fields that don’t even exist yet. With indirection, the direct coupling of scripts and fields is relaxed, enabling previously impossible powers. The key is that it uses a calculation to determine the field name being set:\n“My Table::Price ” \u0026amp; #P(“which”) It is simple really. Just a text formula that results in the name of the field we want, complete with its table occurrence name.\nThis ability to target a field and value works in both Browse mode and Find mode, so it can be used to manipulate data generically, and to do generic find scripting.\nGetFieldName The script above has one substantial weakness. If, for some reason, you ever rename your Price fields, your script will simply break. Normally in FileMaker, of course, renaming things is no problem. FileMaker just fixes things up for you (because it references fields by an internal ID rather than by name). But it has no way to know how to rewrite your calculation to accommodate a new name.\nMany people (myself included) would consider this an unacceptable tradeoff. First and foremost, our code should not break. Luckily, the good folks at FMI have anticipated this problem, and they’ve come up with a clever solution in the GetFieldName function. When you pass a field to this function (a real field reference, not the name of a field in quotes) it will give you back its name. Assuming your Price fields will always use the same naming convention, you can make your script safer like this:\nSet Field by Name [ Left( GetFieldName(My Table::Price 1), Length(GetFieldName(My Table::Price 1) – 1 ) \u0026amp; #P(“which”); #P(newPrice) ] This version uses the Price 1 field as an example of the appropriate field name. It removes the 1 from the end of the field name, then inserts the appropriate number. Now things will keep working, even if you decide to rename the fields thusly:\nPrice Per Unit 1 Price Per Unit 2 Price Per Unit 3 Price Per Unit 4 Price Per Unit 5 Parameters The GetFieldName function isn’t only useful when hacking up field names like the example above. You can use its results directly as well. For instance, you might write a script that performs some text manipulation you often need. This script can manipulate any field using Set Field by Name:\nSet Field by Name [ Get(ScriptParameter); /** my complicated calculation **/ ] If you pass the name of a field as a parameter, this script will set the field you specify. The complicated calculation can even use the GetField function to reference the field in question. A simple example might be:\nSet Field by Name [ Get(ScriptParameter); Upper(GetField(Get(ScriptParameter))) ] This script converts the contents of a field to upper case, and you can pass any editable field’s name as a parameter, making it totally generic. (Of course the script could be much more complex than this sample, incorporating multiple calls to Set Field by Name, conditionals, looping, and so forth.)\nTo keep your code safe, don’t call it like this:\nPerform Script [ My Script; “My Table::Some Field” ] The script parameter in that example is fragile because it will break if the field name (or table occurrence name) changes. Instead, call it like this:\nPerform Script [ My Script ; GetFieldName(My Table::Some Field) ] This version is impervious to name changes because GetFieldName will always return the right field name, even if you change it later. You still get all the flexibility though — you can still pass any field you want to the script to operate on it.\nCalculation Fields In the comments to our overview article on FileMaker 10, one of our readers, Michel Vincent, asked us about using indirection inside self-referencing calculated fields. This is even more mind bending, and I don’t have a good example (I hadn’t even thought of it before), but the core capability is there. For instance, suppose you have a calculation field called “Mind Bender” with this formula:\nGetFieldName ( Self ) If you look at this field in Browse mode, it will contain its own name. If you rename the field, the content will update accordingly. You could combine this with various as-yet-unimagined calculations to produce powerful results. The reader envisioned a system of field naming conventions to help manage XML formatting of data, as an example.\nNote: In fact, I think naming conventions combined with these indirection features will prove to be a powerful combination. In our next article on indirection, you’ll see how we use our primary key naming conventions to streamline some common script code we use ever day. Wrapping Up Indirection — the power to determine which fields are modified when the script runs rather than when it is written — is a feature of many very advanced programming environments. In fact, in a more evolved form, it is what makes object oriented programming so flexible.\nIt has been possible for years to get some semblance of indirection out of FileMaker using complicated, slow, and fragile layout-based scripting techniques. But now, these features are fully supported, reliable, and fast. We are excited to see what our readers come up with.\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/sfr/set-field-by-name-exposed/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Set Field by Name Exposed"},{"content":"If you thought FileMaker 9 was a big update (and we clearly did) you’ll be thrilled with number 10. It starts with some flagship new features like Script Triggers (finally!) and infinitely more useful Sub-Summary parts, plus the usual round of small tweaks and improvements. But this release takes it one step further with a total overhaul of FileMaker’s most ubiquitous interface element. Gone is the Status Area, replaced by a freshly designed, much more useful Status Toolbar. Here, we’ll introduce you to everything new in FileMaker 10. Keep an eye out for more articles about how to use all this great new stuff.\nUpdate Jan-5-2009: Somehow I neglected to cover the new Modify Table View feature in Filemaker 10. I have updated the article with relevant information, as it is quite important.\nUpdate Jan-6-2009: I corrected the explanation of the [Code][code] function, which was stupidly dismissed in the original text.\nUpdate Jan-15-2009: I’ve uploaded the live sub-summaries demo file by request. Get it here: People.fp7.\nEverything Old is New Again Here’s what a basic FileMaker database window looked like yesterday (and in fact, it looked a lot like this when I started using FileMaker 15 years ago):\nFor as long as I can remember, a FileMaker window looked like this.\nAs of today, it looks like this:\nBut as of FileMaker 10, it looks much more modern and consistent with other applications.\nAs my mother would say…holy catfish. The most striking change, of course, is that the tools are on top now instead of along the side. This will almost certainly rub a lot of people the wrong way because carefully designed layouts that fit in perfectly sized windows on small screens will now be the wrong size and shape. After all, the maximum window size just got a little wider and a little shorter.\nNote: Of course, if you keep the status area hidden in your solution, your database windows are significantly smaller than the screen, or you make heavy use of auto-resize, then you won’t have to worry about the size change. I hope the uproar over this annoyance doesn’t overwhelm the chorus of praise, though. After all, the new Status toolbar (it’s not called the Status Area anymore) beats the old version in several important ways:\nIt does lots more. In the picture above, you can see buttons to manipulate the found set, perform finds, and bring up the sort dialog box. Switching between views (you know, Form, List, and Table) is now a quick click away, and the Edit Layout button makes quick work for mousers. Its horizontal configuration makes better use of space. Finally, the Layout pop-up menu is wide enough to show reasonable layout names. You can see the difference by comparing the layout pop-up menu in both pictures above. The new version is clearly much bigger. It is customizable. Your more adept users can now add buttons to the status toolbar for common FileMaker functions, move things around, switch between large and small icons, and so on. The changes they make will apply to every database they use, introducing a little consistency for folks who use several different databases. This is probably a matter of opinion, but to my eye, it is a lot prettier. And I like pretty things. Finally, it is more consistent with other applications, especially on Mac OS X. In fact, Mac OS X users will recognize this as a stock-standard toolbar that works just like other applications. And Windows users will still be comfortable with the more common buttons-across-the-top arrangement. Note: Before you get your hopes up, you should know that the status toolbar can be customized by the user, not by the developer. You can’t script the placement of buttons, add new buttons, or otherwise control how your users see things. They get to decide how their toolbar is arranged. Of course you can still hide the status toolbar, and keep it locked away from your users, so you haven’t lost any control here. A full discussion of the new status toolbar would require an entire article, so for now it will suffice to say it really represents a massive refinement and rethink of the way people interact with FileMaker, both as users and as developers.\nIt is not simply a cosmetic change. Instead, things have been reconsidered in intelligent, friendly ways. It makes common tasks easier to get to, and helps new users discover FileMaker’s features more naturally. On the thoughtful side, consider the black-ish layout bar which attaches itself under the status toolbar whenever you’re in layout mode:\nThe Layout toolbar shows more than ever before without sacrificing much space at all.\nIt politely shows you the context of the current layout (right after “Table:”) which is important information, and was squirreled away in a dialog box in FileMaker 9. And its little pencil icon gives you one-click access to the Layout Setup dialog box.\nOne final staff favorite: In Browse mode, when you click the clever pie-chart representation of the found set, FileMaker runs the Records → Show Omitted Only command. You can quickly click to swap the found set in and out, and the pie chart makes it clear what is happening.\nNew users will quickly discover the Edit Layout button when in Browse mode. In truth, it is simply another way to get to Layout mode, but it is presented here in a way that saves first-timer’s a trip to the online help. It switches to an Exit Layout button once you get to Layout mode, so getting back is just as easy and obvious.\nIndividually, these may seem like inconsequential things, but FileMaker 10 is full of subtle refinements like this, and all together, they really make for a more sensible, approachable, and convenient interface. Once you get used to using 10, you’ll find yourself missing the new arrangement whenever you switch back to 9.\nNote: Although the interface redesign is a significant positive step, I don’t want to over sell it. Visually, nothing has changed inside the database window. Pop-up menus still look retro-80’s. Radio buttons still render funny on Windows. Checkboxes still look like something my 7 year old drew in KidPix. Alas, we get no shiny on our layouts in this release. Just a much better experience in the parts FileMaker controls directly. Loaded and Ready Without a doubt, Filemaker 10’s most significant new feature is script triggers. This fabled hero has, over the years, gone by many names: events, triggers, actions, behaviors… Whatever you call it, here’s the scoop: In FileMaker 10, you can cook things up so scripts run automatically in response to various actions. For instance, imagine you want some scripted magic to happen whenever someone clicks to a certain tab in your tab control. In FileMaker 9, the intrepid developer would have to delve into hidden tabs, masked buttons, and who knows what else to pull this off. After all, scripts run when people click buttons, so you have to trick the user into clicking a button when they really want to select a tab.\nImagine you could turn that reasoning upside down, though. Instead of thinking about clicks, think about actions. As in: When the user switches tabs, run this script. That’s the gist of triggers. FileMaker runs your script in response to something. In this example, you can tell FileMaker to run your script when the tabs are modified—when someone changes which tab is selected.\nTriggers are associated either with the layout (choose Layouts → Layout Setup, then switch to the Script Triggers tab) or a single layout object (select the object, then choose Format → Set Script Triggers). Some triggers even have the power to cancel the original action by exiting the script with a result of False. For instance, if a script triggers when a record is committed, and it exits with a result of False, then FileMaker won’t commit the record. In this way, your scripts can gain a little control over the under-the-hood behavior of the application itself.\nOn the layout, you can trigger scripts in these scenarios:\nOnRecordLoad fires when a new record is “loaded” when the user is on the layout. In other words, when the user flips to a new record with the book icon, performs a find, makes a new record, and so forth. OnRecordCommit triggers when a record is committed. As mentioned before, this action can be canceled by the triggered script. OnRecordRevert kicks in when a record is reverted. This one is cancelable too. OnLayoutLoad fires when you switch to the layout. Imagine leaving the Status toolbar unlocked, and performing special finds, sorts, and so on automatically as your users switch layouts. OnLayoutKeystroke has the power to act with every keystroke. This is sort of the super-power trigger, allowing you to build single-stroke navigation systems, filter keystrokes based on criteria, and probably a thousand other as-yet-unimagined things. As you probably guessed, your script can cancel the keystroke, as though it was never pressed. OnModeEnter runs a script when the user switches to one or more specified modes. You could switch to a print-formatted layout automatically whenever the user goes to Preview mode, or use a special layout for Find mode, for instance. OnModeExit is a slight variation on OnModeEnter: it fires right before you leave a mode. This way your script can see which mode the user is switching from and can even cancel the switch if you want. The triggers for layout objects are:\nOnObjectEnter lets you know when a field has been entered, a button or tab has been tabbed to, or a portal row has become active. It also fires when you click on the page in a web viewer, or tab to a field on the page. OnObjectKeystroke is just like OnLayoutKeystroke, except it only jumps to action when you press keys while the object has focus. In other words, when you’re clicked into a field, or a button or tab control has the thick black border you see when you tab to it. As before, you can cancel keystrokes. OnObjectModify is the swiss army knife of triggers. For fields, it triggers whenever you’re in the field and change its value in any way (by typing, deleting, pasting, cutting, and so forth). Incidentally, it does not fire if you drag text from one field to another since, by definition, you’re not in the field you drag to. Bummer really. Many times, if you think you want an OnObjectKeystroke trigger, you really want an OnObjectModify trigger instead. For instance, OnObjectModify doesn’t fire when you use the arrow keys to move around in a field, or when you tab to another field. OnObjectKeystroke does fire in these situations, making it more powerful, but also much more difficult to work with. Finally, OnObjectModify also fires for tab controls when you switch from one tab to another. OnObjectSave does its thing when you finish making changes to a field. You can type, delete, cut and paste, and otherwise mangle the field’s data to your heart’s content without firing scripts. Then, when you tab out of the field, commit the record, or otherwise cause FileMaker to get you out of the field, the OnObjectSave trigger kicks in. It only fires if the field was actually modified, and it can cancel, meaning the user is not able to exit the field until they satisfy the demands of your script. OnObjectExit works just like OnObjectEnter, except it fires when you leave the object instead of when you go to it. Once again, it is cancelable, which prevents the user from moving on to something else. It is worth noting that the power to cancel runs deep. If you write an OnObjectSave script that exits with a False result, FileMaker won’t let the user leave the field. Period. Even if they try to switch to a different record, change layouts, close the window, or even quit FileMaker. In every case, the action will simply not happen at all. It is up to your script to provide reasonable feedback to the user (like a custom dialog box or a beep). And of course, if you make a mistake and your script always exits this way, you’ll essentially be stuck in the field forever, so you really need to be careful. (Luckily, triggered scripts work perfectly with the script debugger in FileMaker Pro Advanced, so you can just turn on the debugger, exit the field, then kill the trigger script to work around your troublesome code.)\nI’d be a fool to try and predict the kinds of techniques we’ll see popping up here and there once people really begin to explore script triggers. I think this is one of those game-changer features: Ball’s in the air and it’s anyone’s guess where it will come down.\nTip: A new View → Show → Script Triggers menu command was also added in Layout mode. Turn this on to see a little red star icon attached to any object on the layout that has script triggers. This is super useful, for instance, to help keep you from accidentally duplicating a trigger-happy field for some unrelated use. Sub-Summaries Like Never Before This is a feature that’s easy to explain, requires almost no new learning, and will knock your socks off. Everything you know about sub-summary reporting now works in Browse mode. It’s almost magical to see elegant grouped lists instantly adapt as you edit records, and change the sort order, all the while remaining fully clickable. In this case, a video says it better than words:\nIn FileMaker 10, summary parts work in browse mode, massively expanding the usefulness of these already-very-useful tools.\nYou can download the sample database used in the video here: People.fp7. The Persistent Sort If you paid close attention to the video above, you may have noticed something else new: Records stay sorted. If you sort your contact list by City, for instance, then update the address for someone who moved, the record you edit will instantly jump to the correct sorted position. In other words, the storied state of “semi-sorted” is almost a thing of the past. (“Almost” because it can still crop up when importing records into a sorted list, or when using the Replace Field Contents and Relookup Field Contents commands.)\nIn truth, once you get used to this behavior, you’ll probably wonder why it didn’t work this way all along. It just feels natural. Best of all, you don’t have to do anything as a developer to take advantage of this feature. It Just Works™.\nFind and Find Again Here’s another feature that’s more for the users than the developers, but it’s still super cool. The Records menu now has a Saved Finds submenu, where FileMaker keeps track of the most recent find requests you’ve used, lets you perform them over again, and even lets you save a frequent find with a special name. You get the same menu if you click-and-hold on the Find button in the status toolbar:\nYou users get powerful new saved find request features out of the box.\nIf your users often perform the same finds over and over, they no longer need to beg you to write them a script. Instead, they can do the find once, then choose Save Current Find… to add it to this menu. Now, the same find (with as many requests and criteria as they want) is just a few clicks away.\nThe list of saved finds is stored with the user’s account, so if your users each log in with a separate account (even with External Authentication), they’ll have their own persistent set of saved finds. What could be simpler?\nSend Mail the Old Fashioned Way There are two kinds of people in the world: Those who see the following picture and think, “It’s about time!” and those who…don’t. Which one are you?\nFileMaker can now send email directly via the server rather than relying on an installed email program.\nStarting with FileMaker 10, your scripts (and users, if you so desire) can send email directly through a so called SMTP Server (in other words, an industry standard email handling system). When you send an email this way, it bypasses the mail program on the local computer completely. You don’t have to worry about configuring an email client on a robot computer, or supporting Lotus Notes version 9.2.8.8.3.1.3, or confusing your users with mysterious pop-ups. Instead, your FileMaker solutions can act just like real email programs, delivering any message you want to anybody you want with no interference.\nYou can even customize the email address the message comes from, so long as it is allowed by your mail server. Put another way, you can now send email quickly, cleanly, and reliably without special plug-ins. As an added bonus, when you use this option in your scripts, they can be run by FileMaker Server as a scheduled script.\nDon’t be lulled into thinking you should always use the SMTP Server option in your scripts though. The older behavior is still available (and the default) by way of the E-mail Client option. And it is still the right choice if you want your users to customize the message before it sends, or if it is best for them to see it in their Sent Mail folder. Now, you get to decide which model works best in each situation. And remember, this feature should be used only for good, never for evil.\nAll Hail the Tab Order Have you ever had to add a new field to a layout that has lots of fields and a very particular tab order. If so, you have, no doubt, cursed the engineers at FileMaker Inc. a time or two, while you click…every…darn…field…over…again. Apparently one of those engineers ran in to the same problem when helping their partner keep track of their antique Pez dispensers. Because that person, bless them, stayed late one saturday night and fixed the problem.\nAs of today, my friends, you can now insert a field into the tab order. For example, suppose you already have fields numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. You then add a sixth field to the layout, which really should go right between 2 and 3. No problem: Just choose Layout → Set Tab Order, put a 3 in the arrow by the new field, and marvel as FileMaker renumbers the rest for you. 3 becomes 4. 4 becomes 5. And yes, ladies and gentleman, for a limited time only, 5 becomes 6.\nWe’d call this feature a great leap forward, but seriously, when you have nowhere to go but up, it’s more of an obligatory lurch forward. None the less, thank you engineer person. You’ve given us our lives back.\nCustomizable Table View Hold on to your socks. In FileMaker 10, users can now add fields to table view without visiting the layout. This adds a level of dynamic data access that has never existed before, which is a great step. Now you can configure a table view layout for your users, and let them add or remove fields as they see fit:\nFileMaker\u0026rsquo;s Table view now gives end users control over which fields display.\nMany of you will gasp in horror at this, though. Now it is painfully obvious that a field that is not restricted by a Privilege Set is wide open for view and edit by a logged in user. That means someone can go to a table view layout, click Modify and add the Password field to the list, or drop in the Cost field and modify it. (If you keep the status area hidden and locked, then this feature is locked away too, so nothing has changed for you.)\nOf course this was always possible in a more round about way: If you have access to a database, you can use its tables in a new database of your creation, where your access to fields is limited only by your privilege set. But a lot of people ignored this problem either because they were unaware or considered it too abstruse to worry about. Now poor access privilege settings can lead to trouble much more easily.\nThe correct solution to this problem is the same as it always has been: Depend on privilege sets to control who can see and edit what data. And “Run with full access” scripts to work around the restrictions as needed.\nAlas, this is a difficult change to make. If you are willing to live with the sort of half-baked security you’ve had all along, the simpler solution is to turn off Table view access for all relevant layouts. This can easily be done in the Layout Setup dialog box. Once you do this, users will no longer be able to pry in to fields without the level of effort required in 9. (And remember, if you have the status area hidden and locked, the user won’t be able to get to the Modify button in the first place.)\nWarning: To reiterate, blocking table view is not secure. But if this new feature causes you trouble, then your system isn’t secure in 9 either. So it is a quick method to get back to the slightly more obscure insecurity you had before. As always, we recommend you use proper security if security really matters. Indirection FileMaker 10 has one new feature that will almost certainly prove to be a sleeper sensation. At first it seems so weird, so obscure, that many will wonder why in the world they would ever use it. But in time, as clever developers put it to use and share their experiences, I’m confident we’ll begin to understand its true power. I’m talking about a new script step called Set Field by Name, and its companion function, GetFieldName. The first works just like the Set Field script step you know and love, except that instead of choosing the field you want to set from a list, you use a calculation formula. For instance, if you want to set the First Name field, you could use a formula like this:\n“Customers::First Name” Or this:\nGet ( ActiveFieldTableName ) \u0026amp; “First Name” Or even this, if you like this sort of thing:\n“Customers::” \u0026amp; LeftWords(“First things first”, 1) \u0026amp; ” ” \u0026amp; Filter(“Nxaxmxex”, “abcdefghijklmNopqrstuvwyz”) To put it succinctly, the result of the calculation is the name of the field you want to set. So if you do this mind-bender:\nSet Field by Name [ Globals::Name, “Something” ] It is not the Name field itself that gets modified, but rather the field whose name is in the Name field.\nBecause storing field names in literal text values in your calculations is inherently fragile (if you rename a field, you script will break), FileMaker 10 also introduces the GetFieldName function. This function, at first blush, seems even weirder. Consider this formula:\n“You have a field called ” \u0026amp; GetFieldName(Customers::First Name) \u0026amp; “.” If you put this in a calculation field or a Show Custom Dialog script step, you’ll see this: “You have a field called Customers::First Name.” When a field is inside GetFieldName in a calculation, you get its name instead of its value.\nIf this just confuses you, don’t worry. You’re not alone. The popular name for this feature seems to be “indirection” or “field indirection.” This is probably because it is tangentially related to a computer science concept of the same name. But I like the dictionary definition better:\nindirection: indirectness or lack of straightforwardness New Oxford American Dictionary That about sums it up. Truthfully, although its use will be rare, it is an exceptionally powerful feature. You’ll see an article or two appearing here on SFR soon showing techniques that take advantage of indirection.\nWhere to Print When you use the Print script step, you can turn on the “Specify print options” checkbox to hard-code printer-related settings like the number of pages, the page range, collation, and so forth. In FileMaker 9 on Windows, in some cases, this checkbox would also cause FileMaker to automatically select the correct printer for you. In other words, if you wired the script to the printer called Sales Office Laser, then anybody who ran your script would get output on that printer too.\nThis printer selection never worked on Mac OS X, and it was a little flaky on Windows. As of FileMaker 10, it is an officially supported feature, and works seamlessly with any printer and on any platform. Now you can force the Fax printer driver in your script, or send bar code labels to the thermal printer, with no user interaction, and no messy plug-ins.\nFile Recovery and Maintenance The Recover process has long been a source of anxiety for even the most capable FileMaker developers. Nobody knows quite what it does, everybody swears off recovered files like plague-stricken corpses, and you have zero control over the process. All that changes in FileMaker 10. Witness:\nFileMaker\u0026rsquo;s new Advanced Recover Options let you pick which esoteric and terrifying steps the recovery process uses.\nWe’ll have an entire article devoted to all these knobs and switches, but as you can see, you have a much greater (and possibly more confusing) degree of control over the recovery process. What’s more, FileMaker now produces a comprehensive log of the entire recovery process, so you can see exactly what (if anything) it changed. On the down side, these logs are somewhat mystifying—you have to know a lot about FileMaker database internals to really make sense of them. Luckily, FMI has promised a whitepaper to help us mortals make the most of it. We’ll provide a link as soon as we find it.\nOn a related note, we should mention the Milli Vanilli of FileMaker features: File Maintenance. This handy command made its debut in or around FileMaker 7, to the cheers of FileMaker developers everywhere. Its compress and optimize operations seemed to speed up our databases while at the same time making the files smaller. Many of us started performing file maintenance as a part of our regular upkeep.\nBut a couple years ago at the FileMaker Developer’s Conference, FileMaker personnel made an apparently official about face, suggesting that we should never use these commands. It turns out the ancient Save a Copy As command, with its “compacted copy” option, performs the same basic service. The difference is that file maintenance operates directly on the open database, which means if anything goes wrong, you can damage your file permanently. If you use Save a Copy As instead, you get a compressed and optimized copy. If a problem arises, the original file is still OK.\nOnce this became clear, nobody wanted to use file maintenance anymore, and a few folks began to wonder why the feature even exists. Why offer an appealing, but unsafe version of an existing useful command? FileMaker apparently agrees. As of FileMaker 10, the File Maintenance command no longer exists.\nMiscellaneous Changes No new version would be complete without a laundry list of relatively minor changes. Here it is.\nESS enhancements… FileMaker 9’s flagship feature was External SQL Sources, or ESS, so it is unsurprising that it ESS got a little love in 10:\nValue lists based on fields from ESS tables are now supported. ESS now supports Single Signon authentication with Microsoft SQL Server. If you don’t know what that means, you also don’t need it. DATETIME columns are now handled more intelligently with Microsoft SQL Server. You get to decide if you want just the Date portion of the value, just the Time portion, or both. You can now use the latest versions of MySQL and Oracle with ESS. A few good functions… FileMaker 10 adds five more calculation functions we haven’t yet mentioned, and makes a subtle change to a sixth:\nThe Char function creates a text character from its numerical equivalent. Now you can insert a Line Feed character in your calculation easily: Char(10)\nThe Code function works opposite to Char. It gives you back the numerical equivalent of the text value you pass in. This is critical information when building scripts for Keystroke triggers. It allows you to handle complex keys like escape, enter, function keys, and so forth.\nThe Get(TriggerKeystroke) and Get(TriggerModifierKeys) functions tell you which keys someone pressed to fire you OnLayoutKeystroke or OnObjectKeystroke script triggers.\nThe Get(DocumentPathListings) function returns a list of paths to every file in the user’s Documents or My Documents folder. Again, I’m not sure what inspired this function. It seems odd that it is limited to just the Documents folder, but I’m sure there’s a reason in there somewhere.\nThe Get(TemporaryPath) function has changed just a touch. It now returns a path to a special folder inside the user’s temporary items folder. Anything you store here will automatically be deleted by FileMaker when it quits. Before, files would stick around until the operating system decided to clean them up, potentially wasting space. In general, this should not effect your scripts at all, unless they make the (faulty) assumption that files created in the temporary folder will be there across restarts of FileMaker.\nImport and export formats… FileMaker can now import data directly from Bento, the Mac OS X only consumer database program FileMaker Inc. released last year. Time will tell if it proves useful, but this means you can now import data from the Mac OS X address book and calendar into FileMaker by way of Bento. Let us know if you come up with any cool uses for this.\nIn addition, a few prehistoric formats are no longer supported for import or export: SYLK, DBF, DIF, WKS, and BASIC. Honestly, we might miss DBF a little, but the rest we haven’t used in years, if ever.\nFinally, FileMaker can now import and export the new .xslx format used by Microsoft Excel 2007 for Windows and 2008 for Mac OS X.\nEdit scripts tweaks… The Manage Scripts window has seen some minor changes too. Script groups, which were first introduced in FileMaker 9, are now called folders in keeping with their function and icon. Also, you can now create an empty script (just like before), or a so called Default Script, which, in homage to FileMaker 5-ish, is a script with a few pointless steps already inserted. I guess the idea here is to show people what a really small script will look like. Thankfully, Empty Script is still the default, so that’s what you’ll get if you just click New.\nEtcetera… Some things really only warrant a bullet point:\nFileMaker now supports IPv6 for database sharing. We don’t have enough expertise here to comment, except to say, “sounds good to us.” The QuickStart panel, another FileMaker 9 newbie, has been redesigned a touch. It now includes recent database, a favorites list, and more. In other words, I haven’t turned it off yet, which is a first for me. A new Launch PHP Site Assistant command in the Tools menu gives you quick access to this web site builder if you have it installed. The Database Design Report has (duh) been enhanced to cover script triggers and the other new FileMaker 10 features. The Starter Solution (template) databases included with FileMaker are now a little less embarrassing. For instance, they actually use real tab controls now. And normalized tables. And other features introduced in the last five years. My notes say there is no longer a hard copy User Guide in the box. I suppose someone out there will care, and with you, I condole. Another Year(ish), Another Release FileMaker has been progressing so steadily since the 7 release, that it would be easy to get a little jaded. But when you look at it objectively, you can’t help but be impressed. I find it heartening that FMI put time into big new power features like script triggers and a less bullet-point-worthy but equally important user interface overhaul. This release certainly looks different, but it also has enough new power to keep people like us busy finding new solutions for a good while.\nAlso, I don’t talk about this much, but because I write books on FileMaker, I typically get to play with the software a little bit before release. I’ve been lucky enough to get pre-release access to most versions of FileMaker since 5.5, so I have a lot of experience toying with new releases at night while I use last year’s model all day. It took me a few days to get used to the new interface in 10 (I kept trying to show the already-visible status area, for instance). But once I was in the groove, I suddenly found FileMaker 9 to be aggravating in ways I’d never noticed before. I think this is the first time that’s happened.\nThe new release completely supplanted my subconscious expectations almost over night. The Layout bar, the Preview button, the Formatting bar, the Status toolbar—all these little changes seem, to me, to fit the way my body wants to work better than FileMaker ever has before. I now feel like 9 is clunkier, like my workflow in 9 just isn’t as smooth as it is in 10. And for a software product I’ve been using almost daily for 15 years, that’s really saying something. I wasn’t convinced at first glance, but now I’m impressed.\nOnly one question remains: Where do they go from here? You almost never see a Version 11 in major software. CompuGlobal Hyper FileMega Pro 1.0, anyone? Cheers, FMI, and cheers, FileMaker community. Let us know what you think in the comments.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/sfr/welcome-filemaker-pro-10/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Welcome FileMaker Pro 10"},{"content":" The Hobbit (Print) by J.R.R. Tolkien ","img":false,"link":"/booklist/2009/","tags":["Booklist"],"title":"Read in 2009"},{"content":"An interesting question popped up on the TechNet discussion list this evening:\nI have a list of records with dates, which often repeat from one record to the next. I want all the same dates to be one colour. Then the next date would be another color. The background color of the date field would alternate from one color to the other as the date changes.\nI’ve never run in to this need before, but it sounds like something that would come in handy. It also proves to be just enough FileMaker challenge to be interesting. Here’s how to make it work.\nNote: This post was updated July 6, 2008. based on feedback from David Zakary, I have added a second example that supports more than two alternating colors. The Problem First, here’s a sample of the kind of data we’re talking about:\nIn this database, the records are sorted by date, and several rows have repeated dates.\nNotice that some dates are repeated from record to record. Here’s how we want the data to display:\nThe rows are given an alternating color background to make records with the same date look connected.\nAs you can see, this technique makes it very easy to see how different sets of records go together.\nFormulating a Solution The goal is simple, but it turns out this is a tricky thing to accomplish in FileMaker. After a little thought, it becomes pretty clear you’re going to be using the GetNthRecord function. It’s just about the only way FileMaker calculations can make decisions based on data in other records in the found set.\nIf you’re not familiar with this function, it’s a special one. It lets you fetch the value of a field from any record in the found set, which is an unusual sort of thing to do. Using it is a breeze:\nGetNthRecord(My Table::My Field, 7) The above formula gets the value of the My Field field from the 7th record in the found set. Simple.\nThe first step in solving our problem is to identify the boundaries. In other words, find the places where the DATE field changes values. You can do just that with a formula like this:\nGetNthRecord(My Table::DATE, Get(RecordNumber) – 1) = My Table::DATE This formula compares the value of the DATE field in the previous record (Get(RecordNumber) – 1) to its value in the current record. If you put this in a calculation field, you get results like this:\nThe new column shows the results of our boundary-finding calculation. It has a value of 0 whenever the previous row has a different date.\nAs you can see, the new field shows a 1 if the date is the same as the previous record, and a 0 otherwise. This is useful information, but it doesn’t go far enough. There’s no way to decide which color each record should use.\nThe Solution Let’s break it down. The color for any given record will either be the same as the previous record (if the date is the same) or different from the previous record. The formula above tells you when the color should change, and when it should be the same.\nSo you need a way to refer to the color of the previous record, compare the dates, and decide if the color should change or not. But there’s no way to determine, from a calculation, the background color of a field in the previous record. Instead, we’ll modify our calculation field so it tells us which color to use. This way, we can look at the value in this field to detect which color is in use. For simplicity, the field will have either a 1 or a 0, indicating one or the other color is appropriate.\nSelf-referencing Calculation Fields A quick digression: It is a little known fact that FileMaker calculation fields can refer to themselves. In this case, our field will refer to its value from a different record, but in fact, a calculation field can even refer to itself in the same record, and FileMaker will just use its current value.\n(At this point I should take a break to reiterate that this technique is a bit mind-bending. Sorry.)\nHere’s what our calculation will do:\nCheck to see if the date in this record matches the previous record. If it does, set itself to the same value it has in the previous record. If it does not, set itself to a different value from the previous record. Here’s the formula that does the trick. Put this in a field called _COLOR (or use a different name and modify the formula accordingly).\nLet( [ previous_record = Get(RecordNumber) – 1; previous_color = GetNthRecord(_COLOR; previous_record) ]; If(GetNthRecord ( DATE ; previous_record ) = DATE; previous_color; not previous_color ) ) You need to Make this field unstored. Otherwise, it won’t recalculate properly as you change your found set or sort order.\nTip: This formula might give you trouble when you try to create the calculation field. After all, you’re creating the _COLOR field, and the formula uses the _COLOR field. FileMaker might complain because, until you’ve OK’d the dialog box, the field doesn’t exist, and you can’t refer to a field that doesn’t exist. The trick is to make the field first, then go back in and set its formula. When you first create the field, just OK the calculation dialog box with an empty formula. Then click Options again and add the correct formula. The formula first sets a couple of variables just to improve readability:\nprevious_record is the record number of the previous record. previous_color is the value of the _COLOR field from the previous record. It then checks to see if the date has changed. If not, it uses the previous_color value. Otherwise it switches the value.\nNote: In this case, I use the expression not previous_color to make the switch. The not operator has the power to turn a 1 to a 0 and a 0 to a 1, which happens to be just what I want. If that makes your head hurt, you can do it like this instead: if ( previous_color = 1, 0, 1 ) Here’s how this field shakes out in our database:\nNow we have a column who\u0026rsquo;s value of zero or one matches the color pattern we want.\nNotice that it perfectly alternates between 1 and 0 along with the dates, which is just what we need. To finish up, just add conditional formatting to your fields using the _COLOR field to help:\nMore Colors If you want to cycle between more than two colors, you can make two small modifications to the formula. Here’s an example that cycles through four color options (0, 1, 2, and 3):\nLet( [ previous_record = Get(RecordNumber) – 1; previous_color = If ( previous_record = 0; 0; GetNthRecord(_COLOR; previous_record) ) ]; If(GetNthRecord ( DATE ; previous_record ) = DATE; previous_color; Mod(previous_color + 1; 4) ) ) The meat of the change is this line:\nMod(previous_color + 1; 4) In other words, when the date has changed, we take the previous color value and add one to it. To keep if from getting too big, we use the Mod function, which has the useful power of “rolling it over” to zero when the value reaches 4. If you want five colors, or three, or 24,601, just modify the second parameter to the Mod function here.\nTo make this change work, though, we had to get a little smarter with the previous_color variable as well. In the original example, this variable would be ? (or “undefined”) for the first record since there is no previous color value to fetch. That doesn’t cause a problem because the not previous_color line turns ‘?’ in to zero for us. But the Mod function isn’t so forgiving. So the above formula also makes sure previous_color always has a valid number value.\nOnce you have this formula in place, you just need to add more conditional formatting rules for 2, 3, and so forth.\nSmokin’.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/sfr/alternating-color-based-on-alternating-data/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Alternating Color Based on Alternating Data"},{"content":"FileMaker’s Save Records as PDF script step is, like, totally awesome. But there’s one teeny tiny issue: it sure likes to crash. We use this feature a lot with our customers, and under the right set of circumstances, we can see crashing on half or more of the machines our scripts run on. Luckily, it turns out this problem is easy to fix. It is such a frequent problem that I thought I’d save the googlers of the world some time and write up the solution here.\nUpdate 3-April-2009: I added a note below about solving the same problem on Microsoft Windows. The Problem First, let me clarify the symptoms and probable causes. Normally when your scripts use the Save Records as PDF script step, FileMaker thinks for a few seconds (or longer depending on your layout) and then produces a beautiful PDF document. Chances are this works perfectly every single time on your computer while you’re developing the script. But on some computers, when your script runs, FileMaker thinks for a few seconds, then “unexpectedly quits.” (Note: “Unexpectedly quit” is Mac OS X’s cute way of saying, “It did something naughty and I killed it dead.”) This almost always happens first right after you roll out the amazing new feature, leaving your users (or customers) a little peeved.\nIn my experience, this problem is limited to FileMaker Pro and Advanced on Mac OS X, and it seems to only happen on machines with Adobe Acrobat or Adobe Acrobat Reader installed (although it doesn’t happen on every machine with this configuration). Once it starts happening, it is typically consistent. Every time you try to save a PDF on that machine (even manually from the File menu) it will crash.\nThe Fix There are two potential causes, and two simple fixes. First, if you’re using FileMaker 9 prior to version 9.0v3, then all bets are off. Upgrade to the latest FileMaker maintenance release immediately. You can find out what version you’re running by choosing the FileMaker Pro → About FileMaker Pro menu command. And you can download the 9.0v3 updater free of charge from the FileMaker web site right here.\nIf you have upgraded to 9.0v3 already, then you have the other problem. A few hours of frenzied Six Fried Rice troubleshooting discovered that this file is the culprit:\n[Your Home Folder]/Library/Application Support/Adobe/TypeSpt/AdobeFnt08.lst This file gets twiddled in some invisible way, and FileMaker is no longer a happy camper. Just delete this file, and try again.\nNote: Thanks to the mad debugging skillzzz of one of our readers, Hans we now know how to fix the same problem on Windows. Look for this file:\nC:\\Users\\[Your Name]\\AppData\\Local\\Adobe\\TypeSpt\\AdobeFnt11.lst\nIn the Adobe folder, you’ll find a Fonts folder and a TypeSpt folder. They both have an AdobeFnt11.lst file but only the one in TypeSpt needs to be deleted. Thanks, Hans!\nI have encountered the PDF crashing problem about a dozen times “in the wild” and in 100% of the cases, upgrading to 9.0v3 and deleting this file has fixed the problem perfectly. Here’s hoping it helps you too.\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/sfr/fixing-filemaker-pdf-crashes-on-mac-os-x/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Fixing FileMaker PDF Crashes on Mac OS X"},{"content":"Most FileMaker Pro developers know the real power of FileMaker can be found in the Manage Scripts window. In all but the simplest cases, a database without scripts is like a four year old\u0026rsquo;s take on the Mona Lisa: \u0026ldquo;What does it do, daddy?\u0026rdquo; If you want your database to actually do something, FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s scripting tools are your best friends.\nOf course if you\u0026rsquo;re reading this, chances are good you already know that. You\u0026rsquo;ve probably been pointing and clicking your way to database automation for a while. Inevitably, though, as your database powers grow, you spend more and more time finding, creating, editing, and managing scripts. Eventually, it becomes really important to take advantage of some of the less obvious powers of FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s script editor so you can save some serious time.\nThe Basics The primary tool in the power-scripter\u0026rsquo;s kit is a pretty simple concept: Copy and Paste. The process is easy as pie: Select something, choose Edit → Copy, go somewhere else, and finally choose Edit → Paste. You can apply this process in two ways:\nFirst, you can copy entire scripts in the Manage Scripts window (Figure 1). Then you can go to another database, open its Manage Scripts window, and paste. Every script you copied from the first database is added to the second, complete with the same names, groups, \u0026ldquo;Show in Scripts menu\u0026rdquo; setting, and, of course, all the individual script steps. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing stopping you from pasting the scripts into the same database you copied them from. It will work as expected: You\u0026rsquo;ll end up with a duplicate of each copied script.\nNote: The pasted script may differ from the original in one small way: If you\u0026rsquo;re not logged in to the destination database with a [Full Access] account, and the original script has its \u0026ldquo;Run script with full access privileges\u0026rdquo; box checked, this box will not be checked in the copy. This is a security feature, and keeps your database safe. It\u0026rsquo;s also a very rare problem. Figure 1The Manage Scripts window (File → Manage → Scripts) shows a list of all the scripts in your database. Don\u0026rsquo;t confuse this with the Edit Script window, which shows all the lines in one particular script.\nSecond, if you open up a particular script, you can also copy one or more individual steps. These can then be pasted into the same script (in a different place), into another script in the same database, or even into a script in another database.\nFigure 2You can copy and paste script steps in the Edit Scripts window. This is the window you see when you open up an individual script.\nIn both cases, you can copy as many items as you want in a single shot. See Unnatural Selection for a little guidance.\nUnnatural Selection FileMaker is chock full of dialog boxes with long lists of items. With a little poking, you can find scrolling lists of tables, fields, value lists, layouts, scripts, script steps, external data sources, and more. Sometimes you need to select items in these lists so you can, say, copy them to your clipboard.\nYou might think this is a one-at-a-time proposition. But FileMaker (like most applications) recognizes an assortment of secret handshakes. With the right gyrations, you can get FileMaker to do your bidding.\nThe most common is the shift-click. Say you have 11 scripts in a row that all work together. You want to move them all to another database. Start by selecting the first script in the list. Then, with the Shift key held down, click on the last script in the list. When you do, FileMaker highlights all 11 of them. More generally, when you click with the Shift key down, FileMaker will select the item you click on, plus everything between it and whatever is already selected. If you mess up, just start over by clicking one script without the Shift key.\nSometimes the scripts you want aren\u0026rsquo;t conveniently assembled in one contiguous list. If you\u0026rsquo;re a Mac OS X user, you can use the Command key (sometimes called the Command key) to work around this problem. Microsoft Windows aficionados use the Ctrl key instead. In either case, with the appropriate key held down, you can click on several scripts one at a time. When you\u0026rsquo;re done, all the scripts will be selected. If you click a script that is already selected, it will be deselected, so its a breeze to fix up mistakes.\nFinally, if you\u0026rsquo;re a keyboard junkie, you can combine the Shift key with your arrow keys to speed your way through multiple selections. First select the first script you want (with the mouse or arrow keys). Then hold down Shift and press the down-arrow key. Each time you press the arrow key, FileMaker will add one more script to the selection. There\u0026rsquo;s no way to select or deselect individual scripts with the keyboard though.\nOf course you can combine these techniques if it makes your life easier. For instance, use the Shift-click method to select 20 scripts in a row, then deselect a couple in the middle. This is loads faster than clicking 18 tiny lines in turn.\nAll the techniques describe here work equally well in all of FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s list-based windows. So you can select multiple individual script steps when editing a script, for instance.\nThe Trouble with Tribbles Like the fuzzy Tribbles of Star Trek fame, rapidly duplicating scripts aren\u0026rsquo;t nearly so cuddly as they might seem at first. A FileMaker script is a lot more complex than a word or two in your word processor, where Copy and Paste reign supreme.\nConsider this: You have a script in your Contact Manager database that helps your users find records. After performing a find, it goes to either a list layout (if multiple records were found) or a form layout (for just one found record). You decide this same logic would make sense in your Invoicing database.\nA few clicks and a copy/paste later, your Find script is now in the Invoicing system. When you run it, you discover the layout switching behavior doesn\u0026rsquo;t work as expected. If this is an exact copy of the original script, how could it stop working? Here\u0026rsquo;s how this script might look:\nEnter Find Mode [Pause] Perform Find [] If [ Get(FoundCount) = 1] Go to Layout [ Contact Form ] Else Go to Layout [ Contact List ] End When you paste this script into another database, FileMaker gets hung up on the two Go to Layout steps. After all, there are no layouts called \u0026ldquo;Contact Form\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Contact List\u0026rdquo; in your Invoicing database. When this happens, FileMaker does the only thing it can do: It moves on. If you open up the script in the Invoicing file it will look a lot like the one in Figure 3.\nFigure 3Sometimes when you paste a script, FileMaker can\u0026rsquo;t figure how to hook things up. The two Go to Layout steps in this script are broken because they referred to layouts that don\u0026rsquo;t exist in the database into which they were pasted.\nThis sort of problem is exceptionally common. Most scripts, when moved to a different database, simply can\u0026rsquo;t be used without some editing. In this case, spotting the problem is relatively easy, and the fix is too: Just select each Go to Layout step and choose an appropriate target layout.\nBut imagine the problem were buried deep in a complex calculation that refers to a field that doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist. Or suppose you have a 200 line script. It is all too easy to completely miss the problem spots until your user runs the script and it accidentally launches a Space Shuttle full of teenagers.\nCheck the Log To avoid these sorts of tax-dollar-wasting joy rides, you need to develop a habit right away: Whenever you paste a script or script step, ask FileMaker if anything went wrong. It knows, and it is willing to tell if you know where to look. But the onus is on you to go looking. (Some would argue that FileMaker ought to pop up a message letting you know things went wrong and where to find details. Actually, everyone would argue that. But alas, it does not.)\nIt turns out, every time you paste a script, FileMaker records comprehensive information about the process in a log file in your database folder. This file is always called \u0026ldquo;Import.log\u0026rdquo; and it is always created in the same folder as the database that receives the pasted scripts. (If you paste more than once, FileMaker just keeps adding more info to the end of this file, so it serves as a running history of all your paste operations.)\nAfter pasting the Find script above, your Import.log would look a lot like the one in Figure 4.\nFigure 4FileMaker creates an Import.log file when you paste scripts or script steps. It can be a little obtuse, but this file tells you everything you need to fix before your script is up to snuff. Treat this file as your checklist for pasted script fix-ups.\nEach line in the file gives you one piece of important information. It starts with the date and time the action took place. This helps you weed out the old stuff and find information related to the paste you\u0026rsquo;re interested in. Next, you see where the action took place, followed by an error number (or zero if that line doesn\u0026rsquo;t represent a problem). Finally, you get a terse explanation of the problem.\nFor instance, consider this line:\n8/11/2007 2:42:04 PM, Invoicing.fp7, 0, Import of scripts from clipboard started That line tells you that at 2:42 PM on August 11th, you pasted a script into the Invoicing.fp7 file. Every paste operation starts with a line just like this, so you can be sure you\u0026rsquo;ve found where the interesting information begins.\nNext, you see these two lines:\n8/11/2007 2:42:04 PM, My Find Script::4::Go to Layout, 105, Layout “Contact Form” missing. 8/11/2007 2:42:04 PM, My Find Script::6::Go to Layout, 105, Layout “Contact List” missing. Again, you see the relevant date and time. This put-the-date-on-every-line is a bit redundant, but it is the way of the log file, so you just have to let your eyes roll past it. This time, instead of telling you the database name, FileMaker gets more specific. It tells you exactly which script, and line number had the problem (My Find Script, lines 4 and 5 in this case). The mysterious 105 on each line is the FileMaker error code. 105 means \u0026ldquo;Layout Missing\u0026rdquo; (see for yourself by searching FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s on line help for \u0026ldquo;FileMaker Pro Error Codes\u0026rdquo;). Finally, FileMaker gives you a plain-english explanation of the problem. It tells you what is wrong (a missing layout) and which item was missing.\nYou may have several more lines like this, depending on how many problems FileMaker had with the script. But eventually, you\u0026rsquo;ll see a line like this:\n8/11/2007 2:42:04 PM, My Find Script, 0, script steps imported : 7 This indicates you\u0026rsquo;ve reached the end of the problems for the \u0026ldquo;My Find Script\u0026rdquo; script. If you pasted more than one script. FileMaker will then list out problems for any additional scripts. Finally, the entire paste operation is wrapped up with these two lines:\n8/11/2007 2:42:04 PM, Invoicing.fp7, 0, scripts imported : 1 8/11/2007 2:42:04 PM, Invoicing.fp7, 0, Import completed They tell you how many scripts were imported in all, and that you\u0026rsquo;ve reached the end of the info about this particular process.\nWhenever you paste a script or script steps, it is imperative that you check the Import.log file and check for problems. You can print the log and use it as a checklist: each time you fix a problem, mark it off the list so you\u0026rsquo;re sure you\u0026rsquo;ve fixed everything.\nTips Aside from fixing problems, Copy and Paste couldn\u0026rsquo;t be simpler. But there are a few tricks that can make the process as smooth and painless as possible.\nThe first tip is a simple one: There\u0026rsquo;s no reason you have to use copy and paste to move script steps from one script to another. It is sometimes useful to copy and paste steps inside a single script. This is especially true when you have a handful of steps you want to move to a different place in the script. While FileMaker only lets you drag one step at a time (making the move tedious) you can copy them all, delete them, then paste them in the new location.\nWhen you paste a step or a group of steps, they are added directly after whichever step you have selected. So if you\u0026rsquo;re using copy and paste to move steps, just be sure you select the step right before the new home before you paste.\nNext up is a tip to save a lot of extra work and potential problems. Whenever you want to copy several connected scripts, you should do them all at once. It might seem like these two processes are identical, but they\u0026rsquo;re not:\nSelect all the scripts, copy them, and then paste them in the new database. Select one script, copy it, then paste. Repeat for each script. Aside from being quicker, method one is more trouble-free. When one script runs another one (via the Perform Script step), FileMaker will automatically keep this connection in tact if you copy and paste both scripts together. If you were to copy them one at a time, you might wind up with a broken Perform Script step to fix. It is not uncommon to have several interconnected scripts you want to move en masse. If you do them all at once, you\u0026rsquo;ll have far fewer problems to fix.\nIf you have a particularly complex script to copy, and you know you\u0026rsquo;re going to have lots of cleanup to do, you can also help FileMaker keep things connected for you. Here\u0026rsquo;s the trick:\nWorking in a backup copy of the file you\u0026rsquo;re copying scripts from, rename the critical elements in the database to match the names in the destination database. For instance, if your script references a layout called Customer Details several times, and the equivalent layout in the new file is called Invoice Details, then you can rename the Customer Details layout before you copy. That way, when you paste, FileMaker will see the names it expects, and you won\u0026rsquo;t have to fix all the problems manually.\nThis rename trick works for layouts, table occurrences, scripts, and fields. So in some cases you can save loads of time by renaming things before you copy. (Imagine, for instance, a script that has dozens of If/Else If steps and Set Field steps targeting a particular field. You can either rename that field once, or fix dozens of problems after you paste.)\nRemember to do the renaming in a backup copy of the original database though. It can be easy to forget to clean things up when you\u0026rsquo;re done, and it is never a good idea to make unnecessary changes to a real system.\nImporting Scripts FileMaker has one more script-moving feature, but really it\u0026rsquo;s just a rehash of the Copy/Paste technique you now know all about. If you prefer, instead of copying a script from one file, and pasting it in another, you can import the script or scripts directly. Here\u0026rsquo;s how:\nIn the database where you want the scripts added, choose File → Manage Scripts. In the Manage Scripts window, click the Import button (it looks like a blue arrow pointing to a document icon). Choose the file you want to import scripts from. In the window that appears, turn on the checkbox by each script you want to import. Moving scripts this way is identical in every way to copying the scripts and pasting them. The scripts are copied over, the Import.log file is updated, and any problems have to be fixed manually. This feature is really just a hold-out from the days when FileMaker didn\u0026rsquo;t support copy and paste of scripts, but if you find it more intuitive, feel free to use it.\nAlso note that although you can import entire scripts this way, there is no way to import parts of scripts, or groups of script steps. If it\u0026rsquo;s just a chunk of code you\u0026rsquo;re after, you need to use Copy and Paste.\nScripting is FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s most powerful — and complex — feature. When you write a lot of scripts, you can be in for a lot of clicking and a lot of work. Using Copy and Paste (or Import), you can reuse the code you\u0026rsquo;ve already written in other places, saving countless hours and minimizing mistakes.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/advisor/moving-scripts-around-with-copy-and-paste/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Moving Script Around with Copy and Paste"},{"content":"FileMaker is a powerful database: You can build full-featured business applications with relative ease, share them with hundreds of users, and pack gigabytes of data away for easy access. Despite all its strengths, though, not everyone uses FileMaker for every database need. The truth is there are lots of situations that call for something a little more massive, either to handle a higher transactional volume, or a large number of users. And even systems that could be built in FileMaker sometimes aren\u0026rsquo;t.\nWhen you bump in to systems built in the \u0026ldquo;big databases\u0026rdquo; you may think your FileMaker system just can\u0026rsquo;t communicate, or that you\u0026rsquo;ll have to hire a Ph.D. programmer to make the connection. But as of FileMaker Pro 9, talking to some corporate databases is easier than you might think. FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s new External SQL Sources feature (called ESS for short) takes most of the madness out of talking to many SQL databases. It isn\u0026rsquo;t as easy as working with FileMaker itself, but you don\u0026rsquo;t have to do any programming, and once you\u0026rsquo;ve made the connection, things almost work just like your used to.\nImagine you want to incorporate some data from the \u0026ldquo;corporate database\u0026rdquo; into your FileMaker Pro-based system. Your company\u0026rsquo;s big database keeps track of all the products it sells. Your little FileMaker database manages all your vendor relationships, so for the most part it lives on its own, helping the buyers keep their contacts. But you know it would be a little more seamless if you could show your users which products were purchased from each vendor.\nUsing ESS, you can put that product data right on the Vendor layout, with no imports, exports, or SQL scripting. The table or tables from the corporate database work just like regular FileMaker tables: You can create relationships, add portals, and drag fields onto your layout.\nGathering Information Before you start dragging fields around, you need to get FileMaker connected to the corporate database. And before you can do that, you need to gather some information.\nFirst, FileMaker has a limited set of databases it can communicate with. So before you bother tracking down all the right access, find out what kind of database (and version) your company is using. If it isn\u0026rsquo;t on this list, you\u0026rsquo;re out of luck:\nMicrosoft SQL Server 2000 or 2005 Oracle Database 9g or 10g MySQL 5 Community Edition Unsupported Databases FileMaker 9\u0026rsquo;s powerful ESS feature only works with a few specific databases. Luckily, the list includes the database systems you\u0026rsquo;re most likely to encounter in the corporate world. But if the database you need to work with isn\u0026rsquo;t on the list, you\u0026rsquo;re not entirely out of luck, strictly speaking.\nSince version 4.1, FileMaker has had the ability to import data directly from any database that supports ODBC. And for almost as long, FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s powerful Execute SQL script step has given your scripts the power to add, edit, and delete records in an ODBC-compatible database.\nIf you run FileMaker on Microsoft Windows, nearly every database you can imagine works with these features through ODBC. And on Mac OS X, the list of ODBC-compatible data sources is growing all the time. Chances are pretty good that whatever database you\u0026rsquo;re stuck talking too, you can use ODBC to get the job done.\nThe trouble with all this, though, is that it is hard. With ESS, FileMaker can talk to a corporate database for you, hiding all the complexities of SQL from you and making things almost as easy as using FileMaker itself. Using ODBC Import and the Execute SQL script step are in a league of their own, though: You have to write complicated \u0026ldquo;SQL Queries\u0026rdquo; yourself to get anything done.\nIf you absolutely must make this work, you\u0026rsquo;ll probably need some SQL help. You might be able to consult with the database administrators at your company, for instance. Or you could find a nerdy friend to help you through the tricky parts. Worst case, you can consult on-line resources or a good book devoted to the database you\u0026rsquo;re working with. SQL is tough, compared to FileMaker Pro, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t impossible.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve determined that you\u0026rsquo;ll be talking to a supported database, you need to get someone to give you connection information. Connecting to a corporate database requires three critical pieces of information:\nThe hostname. This is the name or IP address of the database server you\u0026rsquo;ll be talking to. The username and password. You have to \u0026ldquo;log in\u0026rdquo; to a corporate database just like FileMaker Pro. The database- or schema-name. Most database servers can host several different databases at once. You need to determine which one you want. Getting this information may be easy (\u0026ldquo;Hey Bill, how do I connect to the Oracle Database?\u0026rdquo;) or it may be not-so-easy. In fact, in some circumstances, your database administrator may not want to give you this information at all. Bear in mind, though, that in most cases, they can give you a special username and password just for your system, that is limited to only the things they want you to do. They can even create special \u0026ldquo;views\u0026rdquo; in their database that show just the fields, records, and tables they want you to see, and prevent you from doing damage. If you have a legitimate business case for your access, you should be able to get it. Never the less, in some cases, the folks with the keys may decide your reasons aren\u0026rsquo;t good enough. Once again, you\u0026rsquo;re stuck. Without access privileges, you simply can\u0026rsquo;t use ESS. There are no \u0026ldquo;back doors\u0026rdquo; here.\nMaking the Connection With your access information in hand, you\u0026rsquo;re ready to connect your computer to the SQL database. This is really the only tricky part. FileMaker can\u0026rsquo;t just talk to the database. Instead, FileMaker talks to something called ODBC, which is a part of your computer\u0026rsquo;s operating system. The ODBC system then talks to the database server on FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s behalf.\nSo before you even touch FileMaker, you have to do some computer configuration. You need to create a so-called \u0026ldquo;ODBC Data Source\u0026rdquo; (sometimes called a DSN for short). That just means you\u0026rsquo;ll tell your ODBC system which database to connect to and how. And you\u0026rsquo;ll give this configuration a name so you can refer to it from FileMaker later on.\nCreating an ODBC data source is a two step process. First, you need to make sure you have the correct \u0026ldquo;ODBC Driver\u0026rdquo; installed. On Microsoft Windows, you can get the driver software from your database administrator, IT smartie, or directly from the web site of the database vendor. For Mac OS X, you can purchase drivers from Actual Technologies. In either case, run the driver\u0026rsquo;s installer or setup procedure first.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve got the driver installed, you\u0026rsquo;re ready to create the DSN. On Windows, go to your Control Panels, and open Administrative Tools. (You may need to switch to \u0026ldquo;Classic View\u0026rdquo; first.) Then open the \u0026ldquo;ODBC Data Sources\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Data Sources (ODBC)\u0026rdquo; control panel. Select the System tab, click Add, and then pick the driver you want to use (Figure 1).\nFigure 1On Windows, you use the ODBC Data Sources control panel to add data sources. Make sure you switch to the System tab before you click Add, or FileMaker won\u0026rsquo;t be able to use your DSN.\nOn Mac OS X, open the ODBC Administrator program (it is in your Utilities folder). Then click the padlock icon in the bottom-left corner of the window and enter an Administrator password to unlock the settings. Next, switch to the System tab and click the Add button. Select your driver, and click OK. You\u0026rsquo;ll then be prompted to enter your database connection information (Figure 2).\nFigure 2On Mac OS X, you use the built in ODBC Administrator utility to add a DSN. When you create the data source, make sure you choose the System type, or FileMaker won\u0026rsquo;t be able to use it.\nWhatever your platform, once you\u0026rsquo;re finished entering connection information, save your DSN and close the ODBC configuration windows. You\u0026rsquo;re now ready to use your DSN in FileMaker Pro.\nUsing ODBC Data Sources in FileMaker With a supported database, and a DSN in place, using ESS is a breeze. If you\u0026rsquo;ve ever connected two FileMaker databases together, you\u0026rsquo;ve pretty much got the idea. It is a two step process:\nCreate the External Data Source in your FileMaker database. Add the table or tables to your relationships graph. First, you need to tell FileMaker you want to use the DSN. Choose File → Manage → External Data Sources. In the window that appears, click New. Enter a name for the External Data Source (you might use the same name you used for your DSN, although you can actually use any name you want.)\nNext, select the ODBC radio button. This tells FileMaker you want to connect to an ODBC data source, rather than another FileMaker Pro database. Once you make this selection, a DSN box will appear. Click the Specify button, and you\u0026rsquo;ll be offered a choice of DSNs on your computer, and you can select the one you want to use.\nThen turn on \u0026ldquo;Specify username and password\u0026rdquo; and enter the username and password for your corporate database.\nNote: You can leave this option set to \u0026ldquo;Prompt user for username and password\u0026rdquo; instead. If you do, every time someone opens the database, he or she will have to enter the corporate database username and password again. Finally, turn on the \u0026ldquo;Views\u0026rdquo; checkbox under Filter by Type. This tells FileMaker you want to see any database views your database administrator has created for you. When you\u0026rsquo;re done, click OK.\nFigure 3The Edit Data Source window lets you tell FileMaker which DSN to use, what username and password to use, and what you want to see. This might seem repetitive (after all, you just entered a lot of the same info when you created the DSN). But your FileMaker database may not need to talk to all the DSNs you create. Suppose, for instance, that you use ODBC with Excel as well. You might have several DSNs, and FileMaker may only need one or two of them.\nOnce this is done, FileMaker knows how to talk to your DSN. Now you can start working with the tables. Choose File → Manage → Database, and switch to the relationships tab. Click the Add Table button (it is in the bottom-left corner, and looks like a table icon with a green plus sign attached to it). In the Specify Table window, choose the External Data Source you just created. FileMaker will show you a list of available tables from the corporate database.\nAt this point, you can choose a table, add it to your relationships graph, and make connections to it just like you would any other table. You can create layouts attached to these tables, add portals and fields to your existing layouts, and even write scripts that manipulate data in the tables. They work just like a normal FileMaker table. Told you it was easy.\nMaking the Most of ESS Once you get the ODBC setup figured out, ESS is really a breeze. Everything you know about FileMaker just works. But there are a few things you should be aware of as you begin to work with external data.\nFirst, it is important to understand that, although a corporate database is very fast, it isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily optimized for the kinds of things you can do in FileMaker. Although FileMaker does a good job of hiding all the complexities from you, there are some scenarios where you can experience poor performance. This is especially true if your corporate database has hundreds of thousands, or millions of records. In a situation like this, you can experience long delays if you work in list view or table view with very large tables. You\u0026rsquo;re generally best off showing related ESS data in portals, or doing searches so you only see a small number of records.\nAlso, your database administrator may not give you permission to modify the corporate data. When this is the case, FileMaker will show error messages if you try to edit a field, add a new record, or delete an existing record. Design your databases with this in mind: It is better to prevent your users from doing something in the first place than to show them a confusing error message if they try.\nFinally, if you need to add additional calculations to your ESS tables, you can. Just go to the Tables tab in the Manage Database window. Here, in addition to your FileMaker Pro tables, you\u0026rsquo;ll see each of your ESS tables listed in italics. You can add calculation fields to these tables, just like you would with a normal FileMaker table.\nFileMaker\u0026rsquo;s ESS feature is astonishingly powerful. With no programming and only a little complicated setup, you can interact directly with \u0026ldquo;high end\u0026rdquo; databases with ease. It can be extremely empowering to see your corporate data appear instantly right next to your FileMaker data. Maybe today is the day you should give it a try.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/advisor/use-filemaker-with-sql-databases/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Use FileMaker with SQL Databases"},{"content":" This article is out of date now. If you’re using FileMaker Pro 10 or later, you can accomplish this goal more easily using script triggers. See this newer article for details. If you use Tab Controls a lot (and don’t we all?) then you may have run into a little snag: When you switch to a different layout, then come back again, the default tab panel comes back to the front. This is usually not a big deal. But sometimes you have a script that switches layouts just for a moment. When this script runs, the user never sees the layout change, but they do see the tab control mysteriously bounce back to its home base. This article shows you how to fix this problem once-and-for-all.\nNote: As usual, I’m going to pontificate here a bit before I get to the solution. If you just want the goods, scroll to the end where you’ll find the relevant scripts and sample usage. If, on the other hand, you enjoy my ramblings, just keep on readin’ The Problem If you’re wondering what, exactly, we’re talking about here, consider this. You have a tab control on your layout that looks something like this:\nA basic tab control.\nNow suppose you have a button in the Note tab to add a new note record. It runs this script:\nFreeze Window Set Variable [ $contact_id, CONTACT::ID ] Go to Layout [ #Note ] New Record / Request Set Field [ NOTE::CONTACT_ID ; $contact_id ] Go to Layout [ Original Layout ] When your user clicks this button, they won’t see much happen on the screen at all, since the script happens quickly, behind the scenes. But unfortunately, because of the layout change, FileMaker will switch back to the default Address tab:\nIck.\nA Specific Solution In the end, we’re going to solve this problem very generically, using some lesser-known FileMaker features. But before we get there, we’ll solve this one case the so-called easy way. What we want is a way to switch our tab control back to the Notes tab at the end of the script. This, it turns out, isn’t really that hard.\nFileMaker 8.5 introduced a new script step called Go to Object for just this purpose.\nFileMaker 8.5 introduced the Go To Object script step when you need to \u0026ldquo;go to\u0026rdquo; something that isn\u0026rsquo;t a field.\nBut this script step wants an Object Name. In 8.5 and later, it turns out you can name any object on the layout, including individual tab panels. Once you give the Notes tab panel an object name, this script step will cause it to come to the front.\nWhat\u0026#39;s in a name? You might be thinking, “But the Notes tab panel already has a name: Notes.” Confusing? Yes. But in truth, “Notes” is the tab panel’s label. Its name is something completely different, and for good reason. Suppose you decide to abbreviate a tab panel label, or translate it to French, or improve its wording for clarity. Whatever the reason, you can change tab panel labels all you want, and never worry that you’re breaking a script. Because your scripts use the object name, which your user never sees, and you are unlikely to need to change. To change an object’s name, you use the Object Info palette (View → Object Info):\nThe Object Info palette gives you lots of control over an object. You can precisely enter its size and position, configure its Auto-resize behavior, and—most important for this technique—edit the \u0026ldquo;Object Name\u0026rdquo;.\nIn Layout mode, just select the object you want to name, then type something in the Object Name box in this window. Tab controls are a little tricky though: You need to be sure you select the tab panel itself. This usually requires two clicks on the tab — one to bring it to the front, and a second to select it. When a tab panel is selected, the tab itself will have a heavy black outline:\nIn Layout Mode you can select individual tab panel buttons by clicking a second time after bringing the tab to the front.\nOnce you select a tab like this, you can name it in the Object Info palette. In this example, I named the tab notes_tab.\nNote: There’s no rule that you have to use underscores, or can’t use spaces or capital letters. You can name an object just about anything you want. I like geeky names like this to remind me that these names are not user-visible. Finally, just add the Go to Object step to the end of the script:\n… Go to Object [ Object Name: “notes_tab” ] … Now, when the script runs, it switches layouts, does its job, switches back, and then brings up the Notes tab. From the user’s perspective, it all just works:\nA Generalized Solution The solution above works well in a simple case like this. But it has a few flaws:\nThis script assumes we always want the Notes tab to appear. What if this button were unrelated to the tabs? Then we wouldn’t really want to go to the Notes tab every time. Instead, when we return to the original layout, our script would have to switch to whatever tab was showing before. That would require more complicated scripting.\nThis layout only has one tab control. What if it had two? Or five? The script makes sure the Notes tab is showing, but what about all the others? It would be annoying to the user to have other tab controls switching by themselves, and it would be annoying to the developer to have to hand-code a solution for each and every tab control in each and every script.\nIf you solved both these problems, you’d have to think pretty hard. And I don’t like to think hard any more than absolutely necessary. It is, in my mind, not ideal to have to repeat complicated tab-management scripting in every script that changes layouts.\nNow, imagine a more generic solution. Suppose there were a way to get FileMaker to “memorize” the state of each and every tab on the layout. Then, later, you could ask FileMaker to restore those states. This way, you wouldn’t have to worry yourself about which tabs are showing in particular. And you could have as many tab controls as you want on a layout. In fact, you could add and remove tabs and tab controls at any time, and never have to modify any tab management scripting.\nBest of all, it is easy to add a Memorize step to the top of your script, and a Restore step to the end each time you need it. No thinking necessary.\nSo how would you go about implementing such a thing? It is possible, but a touch tricky. Of course you’ll have two scripts. The first will memorize tab states, and the second will restore them. So let’s take them one at a time.\nMemorizing tab states… To memorize all the front-most tabs, you’ll need some way to look at each one. This, it turns out, is pretty easy. FileMaker has a function called LayoutObjectNames that gives you back the name of every object on the layout. Unfortunately, it gives it to you in a rather odd format, chock full of \u0026lt; and \u0026gt; signs to indicate how things are nested. For this solution we don’t care about any of that, so we simply get rid of it. Our script, then, starts like this:\nSet Variable [ $object_names, Value: Substitute( LayoutObjectNames(Get(FileName); Get(LayoutName)) \u0026amp; ¶; [“\u0026gt;¶”; “”]; [“\u0026lt;¶\u0026#34;; \u0026#34;\u0026#34;] ) ] In other words, we ask FileMaker for the LayoutObjectNames and then substitute out all the \u0026gt; and \u0026lt; so we\u0026rsquo;re left with a clean list. When we\u0026rsquo;re done, the $object_names variable contains a return-separated list of every named object on the current layout.\nNote: That’s an important sentence. This technique only deals with named objects. So for this script to work, you’ll have to give all your tabs names. This is a small price to pay, though, for a user interface that works properly. Just remember, whenever you add a new tab panel, be sure to give it a unique name in the Object Info palette. Next, for each object in the list, we can ask FileMaker if it’s the selected tab panel for its particular tab control. Of course this list of object names could include all kinds of objects. You might have named portals, web viewers, fields, or even lines and rectangles. Technically we’re only concerned with the names in the list that refer to tab panels. But in practice it doesn’t really matter. We’ll say, “Hey FileMaker, is this the front tab panel?” and FileMaker will answer True if the object is, in fact, a tab panel and it is selected. So when FileMaker says True we’ll know both that we have a tab panel, and it is selected.\nIt’s easier to explain in code:\nSet Variable [ $object_names, Value: Substitute( LayoutObjectNames(Get(FileName); Get(LayoutName)) \u0026amp; ¶; [“\u0026gt;¶”; “”]; [“\u0026lt;¶\u0026#34;; \u0026#34;\u0026#34;] ) ] Set Variable [ $i, Value: 1 ] Loop Set Variable [ $object, Value: GetValue($object_names, $i) ] Exit Loop If [ IsEmpty($object) ] If [ GetLayoutObjectAttribute($object, \u0026#34;isFrontTabPanel\u0026#34;) = True ] Set Variable [ $front_tabs, Value: $front_tabs \u0026amp; $object \u0026amp; ¶ ] End If Set Variable [ $i, Value: $i + 1 ] End Loop Set Variable [ $$memorized_tab_states; Value: $front_tabs ] This snippet of script needs to loop through a return-separated list. To do that, it uses a counter variable called $i. This variable starts at 1 and goes up, one by one, until it gets to the end of the list. Hence, the first line sets this variable to 1. Then, this line puts the first object name in a new variable:\nSet Variable [ $object, Value: GetValue($object_names, $i) ] Later in the loop, we set $i to itself, plus 1, and do the whole loop over again. So the second time through the loop, we\u0026rsquo;ll grab the second object name. Then the third, and so forth. Eventually, of course, we\u0026rsquo;ll get to the end of the list. When we do, the $object variable will be empty. So in that case, we exit the loop:\nExit Loop If [ IsEmpty($object) ] Next up, these lines do the real work:\nIf [ GetLayoutObjectAttribute($object, \u0026#34;isFrontTabPanel\u0026#34;) = True ] Set Variable [ $front_tabs, Value: $front_tabs \u0026amp; $object \u0026amp; ¶ ] End If First, we use FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s GetLayoutObjectAttribute function with its isFrontTabPanel parameter to find out if $object is the name of a front-most tab panel. If it is, we add it to a new list in a variable called $front_tabs. When the loop is finished, $front_tabs is a list of all the named tab panels on the layout that are front-most. If you name all your tabs (and you should) then it\u0026rsquo;s a nice list of all the front tabs. Finally, to \u0026ldquo;memorize\u0026rdquo; this information, just put it in a global variable:\nSet Variable [ $$memorized_tab_states; Value: $front_tabs ] Restoring tab states… With a variable listing the front-most tabs, we can pretty easily restore things. We just need to loop through each name in the $$memorized_tab_states variable, and use Go to Object on each one. Here\u0026rsquo;s how the script looks:\nSet Variable [ $i, Value: 1 ] Loop Exit Loop If [ IsEmpty(GetValue($$memorized_tab_states, $i)) ] Go to Object [ Object Name: GetValue($$memorized_tab_states, $i) ] Set Variable [ $i, Value: $i + 1 ] End Loop This script uses a loop with a counter variable just like before. The rest is relatively self-explanatory.\nThe Full Solution To recap, here are the two scripts.\nMemorize Tab States :=\nSet Variable [ $object_names, Value: Substitute( LayoutObjectNames(Get(FileName); Get(LayoutName)) \u0026amp; ¶; [“\u0026gt;¶”; “”]; [“\u0026lt;¶\u0026#34;; \u0026#34;\u0026#34;] ) ] Set Variable [ $i, Value: 1 ] Loop Set Variable [ $object, Value: GetValue($object_names, $i) ] Exit Loop If [ IsEmpty($object) ] If [ GetLayoutObjectAttribute($object, \u0026#34;isFrontTabPanel\u0026#34;) = True ] Set Variable [ $front_tabs, Value: $front_tabs \u0026amp; $object \u0026amp; ¶ ] End If Set Variable [ $i, Value: $i + 1 ] End Loop Set Variable [ $$memorized_tab_states; Value: $front_tabs ] Restore Tab States :=\nSet Variable [ $i, Value: 1 ] Loop Exit Loop If [ IsEmpty(GetValue($$memorized_tab_states, $i)) ] Go to Object [ Object Name: GetValue($$memorized_tab_states, $i) ] Set Variable [ $i, Value: $i + 1 ] End Loop Using these in your own scripts is a breeze. First, memorize before you leave a layout. Then restore when you come back.\nPerform Script [ Memorize Tab States ] Go to Layout [ Whatever ] ... do some stuff ... Go to Layout [ original layout ] Perform Script [ Restore Tab States ] Easy as pie.\nThe Enhanced Solution The solution above will work fine in nearly every case. But here at Six Fried Rice, we like things that work fine every time. This usually involves a tad more complexity. If you\u0026rsquo;re a stickler for safety, like us, you might worry about one tiny detail here. Suppose your script looks more like this:\nPerform Script [ Memorize Tab States ] Go to Layout [ Whatever ] ... do some stuff ... Perform Script [ Some Other Script ] ... do some more stuff ... Go to Layout [ original layout ] Perform Script [ Restore Tab States ] Notice that, in the midst of its work, this script performs another script called Some Other Script. Now suppose Some Other Script looks like this:\nPerform Script [ Memorize Tab States ] Go to Layout [ Who Cares ] ... do some stuff ... Go to Layout [ original layout ] Perform Script [ Restore Tab States ] Do you see the problem? When Some Other Script calls Memorize Tab States, it blows away the $$memorized_tab_states global variable. Now the Restore Tab States call in your script won\u0026rsquo;t work. This problem is even more pernicious if you consider that when you write your script, Some Other Script might not do any memorizing. In that case, your script works just fine. (\u0026ldquo;I tested this! I really did!\u0026rdquo;) Later, you or someone else might add memorizing to the sub script. When you do, you have no obvious way of knowing which scripts might be effected, so you would probably never guess you were breaking things. That, my friends, is how bugs happen even when you test things very thoroughly. In the Six Fried Rice labs, we call upon our dictionary functions to solve this problem.\nInstead of storing the list of front-most tabs in the $$memorized_tab_states global variable, we store a dictionary of tab states. We use the layout name as the key, and the list of front tabs as the value. This way, the global variable can hold a tab list for each layout. Now, if two scripts use these functions, and they call one another, they won\u0026rsquo;t hurt things. Either they\u0026rsquo;re working on different layouts, in which case they\u0026rsquo;ll keep separate lists. Or they\u0026rsquo;re on the same layout, in which case the list of active tabs is the same. Here are the revised scripts. Bear in mind, though, that these use the dictionary functions linked above.\nMemorize Tab States :=\nSet Variabls [ $object_names, Value: Substitute( LayoutObjectNames(Get(FileName); Get(LayoutName)) \u0026amp; ¶; [\u0026#34;\u0026gt;¶”; “”]; [“\u0026lt;¶\u0026#34;; \u0026#34;\u0026#34;] ) ] Set Variable [ $i, Value: 1 ] Loop Set Variable [ $object, Value: GetValue($object_names, $i) ] Exit Loop If [ IsEmpty($object) ] If [ GetLayoutObjectAttribute($object, \u0026#34;isFrontTabPanel\u0026#34;) = True ] Set Variable [ $front_tabs, Value: $front_tabs \u0026amp; $object \u0026amp; ¶ ] End If Set Variable [ $i, Value: $i + 1 ] End Loop Set Variable [ $$memorized_tab_states; Value: DictReplace($$memorized_tab_states, Get(LayoutName), $front_tabs) ] Restore Tab States :=\nSet Variable [ $front_tabs, DictGet($$memorized_tab_states, Get(LayoutName)) ] Set Variable [ $i, Value: 1 ] Loop Exit Loop If [ IsEmpty(GetValue($front_tabs, $i)) ] Go to Object [ Object Name: GetValue($front_tabs, $i) ] Set Variable [ $i, Value: $i + 1 ] End Loop These are just like the simpler versions except they use DictReplace and DictGet when dealing with the $$memorized_tab_states global variable. Whichever method you prefer, these scripts are an essential tool for FileMaker UI work.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/sfr/restoring-active-tab-state/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Restoring Active Tab State"},{"content":"These days, most FileMaker Pro databases are just one file. When you open this file, you see one window on your screen, full of all the data and interface you (or your colleagues) put there. And often, this one window is enough. After all, you can freely switch layouts, perform finds, and (with FileMaker 9 or later) resize the window to get a bigger view. But the truth is, FileMaker can do a whole lot more. You can have as many windows as you want, each showing a different layout, found set, sort order, and so forth — all from the same database file.\nNobody would blame you if you never realized this. After all, the Window menu in most programs is chock full of pretty useless stuff. (Tile Horizontally? Who uses that?) But FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s Window menu is a little more oomphy. You can see for yourself in Figure 1.\nFigure 1In addition to the obligatory fluff, FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s Window menu has a few unexpected goodies. You can hide any window to temporarily get it out of your way, and show a window that\u0026rsquo;s been hidden. And you can make a new window any time you want.\nHiding Windows If you work with more than one database, or your database system has more than one file, then it can sometimes seem like your screen is filling up with windows. Of course your operating system has some tools to help deal with this. On Windows, you can minimize a database window, and it will turn in to a little brick in the bottom-left corner of FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s application window, mostly out of the way. On Mac OS X, you can minimize the window to the dock. But we all know both of these methods are a little messy. If you\u0026rsquo;re a heavy Mac user, your Dock is probably already strained to the breaking point. And those little bricks in Windows are ugly and hard to find when you need them.\nInstead, try this: With a database window open in FileMaker, choose Window → Hide Window. Poof. The window is gone. But it isn\u0026rsquo;t actually closed. Instead, FileMaker has simply wiped (almost) every trace of it from your screen, so it is completely out of site. If you want it back again, just choose Window → Show Window and select the name of the window in question. It will pop back on the scene, right were it was when you hid it.\nThis might seem a little pointless at first. After all, you could just close the window instead. But a hidden window is more convenient for a few reasons:\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easier to call back up again. No trips to the Open File or Open Remote dialog boxes necessary. When you hide a window, FileMaker remembers where you were. Show it again and you\u0026rsquo;ll be on the same layout and record you were before. And you\u0026rsquo;ll have the same found set, sort order, status area setting, zoom level, and so forth. If you database is hosted remotely (on a server that isn\u0026rsquo;t in your home or office) it can sometimes be slow to open. But a hidden window reappears in a snap. Two Types of Hidden Windows Sometimes when you peek in the Window → Show Window menu, you see something surprising: Some of your window names are in parentheses, like this: (My Database). These mysterious parentheses are a source of unending confusion for people who can\u0026rsquo;t stop wondering about such things. If you\u0026rsquo;re one of those people, here\u0026rsquo;s the full scoop.\nAlthough you may not have done it yet, FileMaker database systems can actually be made up of multiple .fp7 files, all working together to get the job done. A table in one file can relate to a table in another, for instance. You can even write scripts in one file that run other scripts in other files. In fact, this multi-file power is what makes FileMaker capable of dealing with complex, multi-faceted problem and huge amounts of data. But that\u0026rsquo;s a story for another day. The point is, one FileMaker file may \u0026ldquo;depend\u0026rdquo; on another one because it uses stuff from that file periodically.\nOf course if you have this sort of setup, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to manually open every file each time you want to do some work. Instead, you can open one file (whichever one you need). If it, in turn, needs something from another file, FileMaker will open that file automatically, on demand. So that you don\u0026rsquo;t get vertigo, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t show this second file on the screen. After all, you didn\u0026rsquo;t ask to see the second file — your database did, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have eyes. So although the file is \u0026ldquo;open\u0026rdquo; in the strictest computer science sense, it isn\u0026rsquo;t actually open on your screen anywhere.\nWhen you have a file in this state, it shows in the Window → Show Window menu in parentheses. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit misleading because it isn\u0026rsquo;t a window at all. Instead, it is a database file, with no windows, that FileMaker is using. Since you might want to see it, FileMaker shows it in this menu. Choose it, and FileMaker makes a new window for that database and shows it to you.\nSo you may see two things in your Window → Show Window menu: Real windows that you (or some script) has hidden, and database files that don\u0026rsquo;t have windows yet. Windowless files are always shown in parentheses. For the power-users out there, FileMaker never runs a database\u0026rsquo;s On Open script (File → File Options) until a window is shown for that file. So if you select a database in parentheses in the Window → Show Window menu, and it has an On Open script, the script will run automatically.\nCreating New Windows Hiding windows is all well and good, but the real power swings into play when you start making new windows. It\u0026rsquo;s easy: just choose Window → New Window. FileMaker makes a brand new window, just like the one you were looking at (Figure 2). This concept is a little confusing for some users because folks tend to think of the window on the screen and the database as one-and-the-same. If it helps, think of it this way: the window is just that — a \u0026ldquo;winodw\u0026rdquo; into your database. Like any good architect, you can put as many windows in there as you want.\nYou can stretch this analogy too: When you look in each window, you see the database form a slightly different perspective. One window might show a list of Sprockets. And another might show a Supplier Detail layout. This way, you can be reading supplier info in one window while you type notes in the other. But the underlying database is still the same. If you change that supplier\u0026rsquo;s name in one window, the change appears instantly in every other window where the same field is visible.\nFigure 2One database with two windows. You can look at different records — or even different layouts — in each window to compare, copy, or otherwise maximize your database productivity.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll probably think of a lot of reasons to use multiple windows. But there are a couple of common situations where most people find them handy. Sometimes you\u0026rsquo;re in the middle of some multi-step process. Maybe you are doing a series of finds with Constrain and Extend to narrow down just the right set of people for the Holiday Promotion. Now suppose someone calls, and you need to look up a customer. Of course if you just do the find, you\u0026rsquo;ll loose the found set you\u0026rsquo;ve been working on. Instead, choose Window → New Window first. Then find the person you\u0026rsquo;re looking for. When you\u0026rsquo;re done, close the new window, and you\u0026rsquo;ll be right back in the old one, ready to pick up where you left off.\nOften, you need to compare two records. Maybe you\u0026rsquo;re checking for duplicates, or trying to figure out which product is right for a particular customer. Why not make two windows? Find one product in the first, and another in the second, then compare them side-by-side. This way you can quickly compare them and make a decision without a lot of flipping back and forth.\nWarning: As long as a database has one window open, the database file itself is open. And you should never copy an open database from one place to another, or you risk getting a damages duplicate. So when you start working with multiple windows, you need to be careful. Before you copy or backup the database file, be sure you close every window for it. Usually it is easiest to just quit FileMaker first. Scripting Windows FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s multiple-window capabilities aren\u0026rsquo;t limited to the menus. Your scripts have complete control over what windows appear on the screen, what they\u0026rsquo;re called, where they appear, and how big they are. If you\u0026rsquo;re in the mood for some heavy scripting, you can build a powerful multi-window application with FileMaker.\nAlthough a complete explanation of the powers and pitfalls of scripted window management is beyond the scope of this article, you\u0026rsquo;ll find a brief introduction to the important script steps below. You can then begin exploring for yourself how to put these capabilities to use.\nAll the window-specific script steps in Script Maker are conveniently consolidated in one section in the step list, called Windows. The easiest way to find them is to choose Windows from the View pop-up menu in the top-left corner of the Edit Script window. You\u0026rsquo;ll see a list just like the one in Figure 3.\nFigure 3FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s window-related script steps cover a wide range of options. The most important steps are explained briefly in this article.\nTo make a new window, use the New Window script step. The options it provides are shown in Figure 4. Unlike the windows you create manually from the Window menu, in Script Maker you can give your windows a name. You might call one Test List, and another Measurements.\n[ed: Somehow this figure is missing from the original manuscript so it is not in this archived version of the post. The original caption was: \u0026ldquo;The New Window script step offers 5 options. If you leave any of these blank, FileMaker will use a reasonable default, just like it does when you use the Window → New Window menu command.\u0026rdquo;]\nWhen you have more than one window on the screen, your script may need to switch between them. For instance, a click on a person in the Friends List window might bring up the Detail window and show that person in full. To bring a window to the front, use Select Window. You can either choose to summon the current window, or specify a window by name. (Current Window only makes sense when your database system has multiple files, and the running script is from a database whose windows are all in the background.)\nWhen a window is no longer useful, a script can close it with the Close Window script step. Once again, you can opt to close the current window, or any window you choose to name. This time, though, the Current Window choice is more common. When you script is running, Current Window automatically refers to the front-most window for the database. This is usually the window your user just clicked a button in.\nThe Adjust Window script step has a handful of useful options for controlling the front-most window. You can minimize it, hide it, or bring it back. You can also maximize it (so it fills the whole screen) or \u0026ldquo;Resize to Fit\u0026rdquo; so it is just big enough to hold its contents.\nIf you need more fine-grained control over an existing window, turn to the Move/Resize Window script step. This powerful step lets you change the height, width, and position of any window with pixel-perfect precision. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to change one particular attribute, just leave it blank. For instance, to move a window up or down on the screen, put something in the Distance from Top box, but leave everything else blank. As usual, you can manipulate the current window, or specify the name of a background window to move and resize.\nFinally, you can rename an existing window at any time using the Set Window Title step. Just tell FileMaker which window you want to rename (or opt for the Current Window). Then enter the new name.\nCalculations and Window Scripts Almost all the window manipulation script steps accept calculated values for their various options. For example, you can use a calculation with the Set Window Title script step. This lets you, for instance, name a window after the record it is showing.\nFileMaker also offers a handful of more advanced calculation functions to help you work with windows. In particular, you can find out how big a window is, or where it is on screen, using the Get(WindowWidth), Get(WindowHeight), Get(WindowTop) and Get(WindowLeft) functions. These are especially handy when making new windows or moving and resizing windows.\nFor example, if you want to make a window larger, you can use this formula for the Move/Resize Window\u0026rsquo;s Height option:\nGet(WindowHeight) + 10 This formula tells FileMaker to make the window 10 pixels taller than it already is.\nAnother handy (if a bit complex) formula lets you nicely center a window on the screen. Set its Distance from Left to:\n(Get(ScreenWidth) - Get(WindowWidth)) / 2 Then set its Distance from Top to:\n(Get(ScreenHeight) - Get(WindowHeight)) / 3 This puts the window smack in the middle of the screen, left to right. But it also puts the window one third down from the top of the screen. This turns out to be just where you want a window if you want your user to see it right away.\nWhether you take your scripting to the next level to build a powerful multi-window database, or just use the New Window command to make your day-to-day use a little easier, you\u0026rsquo;ll almost certainly find reasons to use multiple windows in FileMaker. It\u0026rsquo;s a power-user feature that\u0026rsquo;s well worth learning.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/advisor/put-multiple-windows-to-work/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Put Multiple Windows to Work"},{"content":"Many people were surprised by Tuesday’s announcement from FileMaker Inc.: A new “desktop database” application called Bento. Nobody I know had any idea this was in the works, and I’m pretty sure it is the first product from FMI that is not directly FileMaker Pro related since Claris Organizer was released back in 1827 or thereabouts. For a FileMaker announcement, Bento is getting a lot of coverage in the Mac media. Here’s our take.\nBento Basics First, the basics: Bento is not FileMaker. It has nothing to do with FileMaker at all. But it is a database application. You can use Bento to build simple databases, and track even large amounts of data efficiently.\nMost striking, Bento requires Mac OS X 10.5 (better known as Leopard). It won’t run on older versions of Mac OS X, and it won’t run on any version of Windows. This is almost certainly because it takes advantage of one of Leopard’s flagship new developer features called Core Animation. When you use bento, you quickly realize subtle (and sometimes not-so-subtle) animations are a big part of the experience.\nThe Bento Way But those are all just technicalities. The real point of Bento, if you will, seems to be a re-imagining of desktop database software. To whit:\nBento has no documents. All your data is stored somewhere in the ether of your operating system, much like your iPhoto and iTunes libraries.\nInstead of Databases or Tables, you have Libraries. Each Library is a lot like a FileMaker Pro database with a single primary table. (Under the hood, libraries seem to employ a few tables, if you assume the whole thing is RDBMS-like, but a Library has one central entity, and is entirely themed around listing, finding, and browsing its instances.)\nBento treats some important system-wide data as first-class Libraries. Specifically, your Address Book, Calendar, and To Do lists are all libraries in Bento, ready to incorporate with your own creations.\nIn Bento, what you might call field controls (the little buddies you put on a layout in FileMaker) and real fields (the things in your tables) are even more intertwined than in FileMaker. When you create a Bento field, you decide if it is a checkbox, pop-up menu, date with calendar, etc. And there are no value lists. Instead, a Bento checkbox has just one value, and a pop-up menu has it’s own embedded list of choices.\nFor the curious, here’s my first stab at a Bento-to-FileMaker dictionary:\nLibrary ~= Database and a little bit Table Collection ~= Found Set (but saved) Smart Collection ~= Find Requests Form ~= Layout in Form View Field ~= Field, Sort of Relationship, Sort of Table There’s more to Bento than this, of course. The entire system seems to try as hard as possible to dispense with complex database concepts and terminology. Gone are tables, relationships, keys, and so forth. And Bento has something called Fields, but they stretch our common notions in many ways. Fields in Bento are sometimes more analogous to relationships, value lists, and even tables. I won’t go into the whole story here (mostly because I’m still trying to fully understand it) but I will say it is certifiably different.\nBento in action.\nIt is important to point out that, much more than with FileMaker, this look-and-feel is set in stone. You can change colors, patterns, and fonts by selecting a theme. (And there is evidence that Bento may include a theme editor in a future version.) But every Bento Library has a List pane just like the one you see here. And every so-called form has a banner across the top with the Library name, record navigation arrows, a big search box, and so forth. You have a lot less control over how your database works in Bento: You decide which fields show on the form, and roughly where they’re positioned.\nIt is hard for someone like me, whose brain is hopelessly embued with FileMaker expectations, to give Bento a fair shake. I honestly can’t say if it is utterly worthless or amazingly cool. The trouble is, every corner I turn in Bento, I can’t help but notice all the things it can’t do. No scripts. No buttons. No conditional formulas. No layout pictures. No multi-predicate joins. No sub-summary parts (can Bento even print? Haven’t tried yet…). But I’m not a good judge. I’m too familiar with FileMaker and I spend too much of my time taking it to its extremes to make it do interesting things. Bento’s obviously not a tool designed for my business and my customers.\nSo I’ll have to reserve judgement. Let’s see how non-FileMaker people respond. But I will go on the record with two points:\nI’m thrilled to see FileMaker trying new things. In the best case, we get a great new app with interesting capabilities and a positive impact on the FMI bottom line. In the worst case, FileMaker gets to air some ideas, try new things, and get the creative juices flowing. I can’t see how that could possibly be a bad thing.\nSome parts of Bento are very clever. I’m not sure how well it all comes together, but some of the ideas are, in my opinion, compelling. I’d love to see it explored more fully.\nNote: There’s been a little backlash from FileMaker developers, along the lines of “I’ve been asking FileMaker for years to add articulated portal sprockets, and instead they give us Bento!” I sympathize. I really do. But not much. FileMaker 9 was one of the best upgrades in FileMaker history. It is impossible to imagine that Bento was started on July 11th (the day after FileMaker 9’s release). Clearly, FileMaker’s been multitasking for quite a while. I would love to see my favorite features added to FileMaker, but as I’ve said before, all told, I think they’re doing a great job improving their core product. And I really am happy to see FMI flexing new muscles. I think it is good for FileMaker Pro. Performance For the record, I don’t think Bento’s about big data sets and high performance. I suspect 2000 records would be considered “a lot” for a typical Bento library. But reason aside, I was curious how it would perform. Here’s what I found out.\nNote: When I downloaded Bento, one of my first tasks was to see if it had any FileMaker DNA at all. I suspected it might share the core FileMaker engine (the same pile of code that FileMaker Server and FileMaker Pro have in common). But a quick perusal of Bento’s application package revealed no FMEngine.framework. So it seems Bento uses some other database for its mundane data handling tasks. I read somewhere it’s SQLite, but I have no idea if that is true. Now before I get in to the results, I should say emphatically that this is not a comparison between FileMaker and Bento. That’s a bit like doing a shootout between Paintbrush and Photoshop. Only, um, the other way around. In truth, I was curious if Bento would simply fall apart when presented with a lot of data. Many desktop applications that manage data have a hard time when you give them lots of data to work on (I’m thinking email clients, contact managers, and the like here). So how does Bento fair as the data grows?\nTo start off, I imported 10,000 records into a faux DVD Collection library I created. I was happy to see that Bento swallowed the CSV file whole and hardly skipped a beat. It took several seconds to import, and then searching, editing, adding, and deleting were on par with a small library. (I say on par here because, in its pre-release form, Bento is a tad sluggish. It is of course too soon to say if this will go away in the final release, but it wouldn’t surprise me if it did. It isn’t slow, per se. Just not snappy.)\nThat\u0026rsquo;s a lot of recipes.\nSince Bento did so well with what I think will realistically be a larger-than-average library size, I decided to really stretch it. So next, I imported a 46MB CSV file with half a million people records (First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone, Address, City, State, Zip). At first I thought things were going amazingly well. Bento chomped happily on the file for just north of three minutes, then seemed to say “All done.” But in truth, it was hurting. The core problem was out-of-control memory consumption. When it finished, it was using about 2GB of RAM, and it took a good 10 minutes for it to become responsive again. It never did begin to behave reasonably, so I quit and relaunched. This time, it behaved relatively well, but memory usage was still high (500MB), I hit occasional hang-ups, and search performance was clunky. It took about 10 seconds to return results on a typical Library-wide search, and four or five seconds when searching a single field.\nFor comparison sake, FileMaker Pro Advanced 9 was able to create a new database from the same CSV in about one minute. The first search took about 20 seconds (while FileMaker built an index). Additional searches on the same field were instantaneous. Oh, and FileMaker’s memory footprint never passed 65MB.\nI wouldn’t be surprised at all if memory consumption eased off a bit in the first release. The truth is, Bento did fairly well considering I was being mean to it. I highly doubt anybody will be tracking half a million baseball cards in Bento. But aside from a memory problem during import, Bento didn’t just roll over dead. Slowness aside, it kept working.\nThe Cool Stuff Of course Bento has nothing to do with speed. The real question is, is it cool? Does it do anything interesting? Can it teach its big brother any new tricks? It should come as no surprise that the answer is yes. It’s amazing how creative developers can be when they get to rethink everything. That’s something FMI hasn’t had a chance to do in 20 years. Here’s a rundown of the things I’ve discovered so far that I really like.\nRelated Records Lists First up, I totally dig Bento’s integration with OS X data. Imagine you’re creating a Projects Library — one in which you’ll track the projects you’re working on in your little home-based business. You might want to keep track of the people involved in the project: customer contacts, subcontractors, and so forth. Of course you could do all this in FileMaker easy-as-pie using two tables and some relational magic.\nBento dispenses with most of that terminology. Instead, in your Projects Library, you add something called a Related Records List. When you do, Bento asks you which library to get this data from (choose your Address Book) and what to call it (I called mine “Contacts”). When you’re done, Contacts shows up right along side all the fields in your Library in Bento’s Fields pane. (This is a little odd, since it obviously isn’t a field. Or maybe it is. In Bento, who the heck knows.)\nWhen you drag this whatever-it-is to your form, instead of a simple input field, you get Bento’s equivalent of a Portal: a scrolling list. And here’s where the magic happens. What is this scrolling thing? Is it a portal of Address Book entries? If so, what key fields are used? How are the tables joined? Bento doesn’t even have key fields, and it certainly never asked me how to match records from these two libraries together.\nIn Bento, it turns out, a Related Records List is something clever and unique. The best FileMaker analogy I can come up with is this: Bento creates a new, anonymous join table that sits between Projects and Address Book. This join table has the power to connect any address book entry to a particular project, although none are connected when you first set things up.\nThere are two ways to make a connection. First, you can pick an existing person from your address book. Just click the Bento\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Choose a related record\u0026rdquo; icon. Bento shows a searchable list of Address Book records (ie: people and businesses in your address book):\nBento can search and select records straight from your system address list.\nYou can select one or more entries in the window, and then click Add to List. Bento makes a connection: The selected people are connected to the Project record, and they show in the scrolling list.\nIf the person you want isn’t in your Address Book yet, you can add them directly in Bento. Just start typing in the scrolling list, much like you would in a portal based on a relationship that allows record creation. As soon as you enter some data, Bento does two things. First, it adds a new entry to your Address Book (your real address book). Second, it connects this new person to the project record.\nThis is all very hard to explain, but relatively obvious and simple in practice. Just tell Bento you want projects to have a list of Address Book records, then go to town. All the complexities of relationships are handled automatically and intelligently behind the scenes.\nAnd Bento’s Address Book integration isn’t some kind of synchronization misadventure. It’s a very live connection, as you can see in this next clip. The Address Book window in the background shows my attempt to search for Benito. Notice it found nothing. But when I add this person to a Related Records List in Bento, it appears in Address Book immediately. And when I delete the person from my Address Book, it disappears from Bento’s list just as fast.\nBento\u0026rsquo;s integration with Mac OS X data sources is live and instantaneous.\nAnd of course it all applies to your iCal calendar and Mail/iCal to-do lists as well. Go ahead and add a list of related calendar events called Meetings, and a list of To Do items for you project. It is amazingly cool really: You go to your project database, add a contact, schedule a meeting, and note a few to-dos. And all the while, you calendar, address book, and global to-do list are all being updated. You get to decide which interface is best at any given moment.\nI do have a few gripes with this part of Bento though. (Well, I can’t really call them gripes. This is pre-release software after all. Let’s call these wishes.):\nFor reasons I don’t quite understand, a particular library can only have one Related Records List for each of the other libraries. For instance, once you tell your Projects library you want a related list of Address Book records, you can’t pick Address Book again for a second Related Records List. What if I want my Projects library to have two lists of contacts: one for customers and one for coworkers? Seems like I ought to be able to.\nBento’s clever relationship handling seems stuck in a -to-many world. I can add a list of related Address Book entries, but I can’t add a single related Address Book record. Imagine you’re building a library to keep track of your DVDs. You might want a way to note who a particular DVD is out on loan to. It would seem like a perfect solution to tell Bento you want a Related Record tied to the Address Book. In this case, instead of a scrolling list, it might show a placard that represents a single contact (you would control which fields show, and where it lives on the form). But as far as I can tell, Bento can’t do this sort of thing. You get a scrolling list of related records, or nothing at all.\nWhile I’m dreaming, it would be super-cool if I had some simple way to add data (fields) to the association. I’m not sure how Bento would present this, but here’s what I mean. Suppose you add a Related Records List of Address Book records to your DVD Collection library. In addition to noting who has borrowed the DVD, it would be cool to note when they borrowed it. Obviously a “When Borrowed” field isn’t at home in the Address Book or the DVD Collection libraries. After all, each person might borrow more than one DVD, and each DVD might be borrowed by more than one person. In traditional FileMaker parlance, this date field belongs in the join table. In database parlance, this is a “rich association.” In other words, there is real, honest-to-goodness data in the association between two records. Whatever you call it, I’d like to be able to do it in Bento.\nThis one is a stretch, but I’d love to see this integrated library stuff extended even more. For example, I wish the emails in my mail client were a library in Bento. And my music in iTunes. And my photos in iPhoto.\nLibrary-Wide Searching Another nice feature (and something I really wish FileMaker had) is library-wide searching. Every Bento library has a prominent Search box in the top-right corner. Type in this box and Bento searches for matching records. You don’t have to fuss about which field to search in at all. It seems to search them all. Whatever it does, it’s nice.\nBento\u0026rsquo;s library-wide search is always availbale, super handy, and fits right in on the Mac.\nI would argue that about 90% of the time, when someone is searching a FileMaker table, they would get perfectly acceptable results by searching every indexed field. Find “Geoff Coffey” or “24-Toothed Titanium Sprocket, Size 2” and you’ll probably find what you want, without worrying about the First Name, Last Name, Product Name, and Size fields. After all, Google has only one search box, and it searches billions of records. If internet search engines have taught us anything in the last 10 years, it’s that a single search field is incredibly handy.\nOf course you can mimic this in FileMaker a number of ways, but they’re all time consuming and potentially resource-wasting. Bento’s built-in search box is awesome.\nCollections Up next is Bento’s notion of Collections. In FileMaker terms, these are saved found sets. And that’s a topic that comes up on the TechNet mailing list about every 36 hours. In Bento, you can select a handful of records and quickly add them to a collection (or make a new collection from them). This is something I’d kill for in FileMaker. All the workarounds to implement this feature are messy and slow. In Bento, it’s built in, fast, and elegant.\nBento actually has two types of collections: so called “smart” collections, and…um…regular ones. A smart collection is like a saved search. You provide the search criteria (“first name starts with G and last name ends in Y”) and Bento performs it whenever you opt to look at that collection. Of course you can do this with scripts in FileMaker, but in Bento, you can do it easily as a user with no coding necessary.\nAn ordinary Bento collection, on the other hand, is just a pile of records from one particular library. You add a record to the collection, and it stays there no matter what you do to the record itself. You can remove it later if you want. You can add more whenever you want. This concept is a lot harder to do right in FileMaker, and it is a powerful feature.\nFinally, Bento’s collections have some hidden power. When you add a Related Records List to a library, you can actually choose a collection instead of a library. When you do, the record list is enhanced in two ways:\nWhen you add a new record through the list, it is automatically added to the appropriate collection as well as the associated library.\nWhen you opt to pick from a list of possible related records, Bento only shows records from the appropriate collection.\nIn Bento, the groups in your Address Book automatically show up as collections in the Address Book library. So if you want, you can make sure contacts you add through a Related Records List in your Projects library all go into a particular group in the Address Book. Once again, the whole concept is very elegant.\nFresh User Interface I can’t tell you how exciting it is to see a FileMaker product with a modern user interface. Don’t get me wrong — I love FileMaker Pro. But even the most die-hard fan has to admit those checkboxes look like crap.\nBento has beautiful system-standard UI widgets and elegant animated heads-up panels. I love that Media fields (Bento’s Container fields) can crop, resize, and reposition images, and even take snapshots right from my iSight camera. And the date picker is a thing of beauty.\nBento has a date picker that has all the gloss and polish of a modern Mac app and make entering dates a breeze.\nBento also has a well-thought-out dialog box for mapping import fields (I like it much better than FileMaker’s). Instead of dragging countless fields up and down in mile-high lists, Bento lets you pick the source field from a pop-up for each destination.\nFinally, it’s calculation editor, while a little rough around the edges, is promising. I love the way it presents aggregate functions — they automatically attach themselves to fields from a Related Records List. And the little blue field tokens are great. You can change which field your calculation uses with a single click, and fields are refreshingly easy to spot. See if you can spot them:\nThe calculation interface elegantly handles finding, selecting, and modifying field references.\nOne area where Bento falls short is its built-in themes. I’m hopeful these are just placeholders in the beta, to be replaced later by nicer versions. This is especially important because you can’t escape them. All of Bento’s themes are kitschy, and you have to pick one. There’s no way to make your own, and no plain-and-simple option. (On the bright side, they’re much less awful than the choices you get in FileMaker’s New Layout Assistant. But that’s a pretty low bar. And at least in FileMaker you can opt for Standard and do your own design work.)\nTo be fair, Apple’s iWork and iLife apps are chock full of kitschy themes too. But they’re a much prettier, more professional brand of kitsch. To my eye, Bento’s themes look a lot like those from Claris Organizer, which was last updated in the precambrian era. In fact, they look a lot like themes you might find in Powerpoint. Shudder.\nFor instance, compare these snippets from a Bento theme and one from Keynote. In both cases, the designers are after a sort of recycled paper look. Keynote gets it right:\nKeynote themes may be kitsch but they\u0026rsquo;re pretty kitsch.\nBento…doesn\u0026rsquo;t:\nBento themes: All the kitsch, none of the class.\nSomebody at FileMaker needs to buy the iLife theme designer a beer, please.\nWhere Do We Go from Here? As I said at the outset, I’m not totally sure what to make of Bento. From a FileMaker Power User’s perspective, its feature set is so limited it almost feels impossible to use. But I wonder what my wife would think about it when she needs to plan a reunion, or find a place to put recipes.\nWhatever happens, though, Bento is a great chance for us FileMaker folks to think about new ways to do things. And to dream of a FileMaker with real pop-up menus.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/sfr/filemaker-gets-bento/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"FileMaker Gets Bento"},{"content":"Costumes by mom.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/flickr/halloween/2007-holly-hobby/","tags":["Photos"],"title":"Holly Hobby"},{"content":"On the off chance you’ve been hiding under an old Microsoft Access box for the last couple weeks, let me be the first to tell you that FileMaker now supports direct links to SQL databases. In other words, you can use table from a MySql, Oracle, or Microsoft SQL Server database right in FileMaker with no synchronization, no imports, and no messy SQL programming. This is A Big Deal™ and many of you are justifiably very excited about it.\nAnd you probably have one burning question: “How the heck do I set this thing up?” The sad truth is that, for reasons well beyond FileMaker’s control, setting up a connection to a SQL database is the opposite of simple. Here’s the skinny on how to get your FileMaker database talking to a SQL database in as few steps as possible.\nWhat is SQL? External SQL Sources (ESS for short) is a technology by which FileMaker can talk to a so-called SQL database. Think of it this way: FileMaker is like a nice SUV: powerful, elegant, and full of amenities. A SQL database, on the other hand, is more like an Abrams Tank. Sure, it’s a heck of a lot more powerful, but do you really want to ride in one every day? The truth is, SQL databases are a lot faster, leaner, meaner, and more oomphy than FileMaker. But they’re sole focus is data: They don’t know a thing about user interface, scripting, printing, PDFs, or any of the other high-level features you use every day.\nTo illustrate, here is what MySql looks like:\nThis baby can hold so much data [slaps empty terminal window].\nUm… ok.\nTo do anything with a SQL database, you typically write queries in a programming language called Structured Query Language, or SQL. So when we say FileMaker supports SQL databases, we mean it can automatically formulate the SQL commands necessary to get data out of and in to a SQL database on your behalf. From your perspective, it works just like any other FileMaker table. But behind the scenes, FileMaker is speaking a whole different language.\nThe parts When your FileMaker database starts using ESS, the number of moving parts in your little system goes up significantly. Instead of a simple .fp7 file, you now have several pieces to consider:\nThe SQL database server The ODBC driver The Data Source Name (or DSN) Tip: Before you dive in, think about where you want to put all this stuff. If you’re using ESS in a standalone database, you’ll install the ODBC driver and set up the Data Source Name on your computer (or the local computer from which you’ll be accessing the data). This applies if you’re just testing, too. On the other hand, if you’re using a shared database, and every connected user needs access to the SQL database, install the driver and Data Source Name on your FileMaker Server. That way it will be accessible to everyone with the minimum fuss. You’ll learn about each of these right…about…now.\nThe SQL database server All SQL databases are hosted with special server software (this is the SQL database, in fact…there is no client-only database like you get with FileMaker Pro or FileMaker Pro Advanced). FileMaker supports MySQL 5.0, Oracle 9g and 10g, and Microsoft SQL Server 2000 and 2005. You must have one of these servers up and running before you can get anywhere with ESS.\nTip: If you don’t have one, and you really want to get familiar with this technology, don’t fear! MySQL 5.0 is free free free. Just slide over to the MySQL web site and download the MySQL Community Server 5.0 or later. It’s easy to install right on your own computer. Just make sure you choose the right download for your operating system. The ODBC Driver In the early days of SQL databases, you had to write special computer code for each and every database. Even though the SQL language itself is fairly standardized, the actual communication protocols used to send those queries to the database were totally different in each system. This was, for obvious reasons, not entirely ideal. So the Open Database Connectivity system was born. You probably know this technology by its more common abbreviation: ODBC. ODBC says, “Listen, you talk to me, and I’ll talk to the database on your behalf.” Now, companies like FileMaker only have one set of programming interfaces to use.\nIf everything is so darned standard, why does FileMaker care what database system I use? Why can’t it talk to Sybase, Postgres, or Oracle 9 3/4?\nWhile ODBC is a solid standard, you’ll note above, I said SQL is “fairly standardized.” Unfortunately, to get the kind of deep and automatic integration ESS provides, you need something a little better than fair. FileMaker needs to know about the intricate nuances of each database it supports so it can produce just the right SQL.\nBut how does ODBC know how to talk to each individual database system? It uses special drivers. You need an ODBC driver designed specifically for the database you’re talking to. If you’re on Windows, this is a breeze. Each of the database servers FileMaker supports has a free ODBC driver ready for you to download and install. If you use MySQL, you can get the driver here. For the others, consult your documentation. The drivers should be available from your software CDs or from the vendor’s web site.\nMac OS X users have to work a little harder (or, better put, they have to spend a little dough.) Most vendors don’t provide a Mac OS X compatible ODBC driver. (The notable exception is MySQL: They pretend to offer a Mac OS X driver on their web site. But it doesn’t work well at all. It isn’t supported by FileMaker. Or anybody else for that matter.)\nInstead, Mac users should head right over to Actual Technologies. This company has high quality, inexpensive drivers available for every database FileMaker supports (and a few others it doesn’t support).\nThe data source name The ODBC driver represents the potential for your computer to talk to a SQL database. But it doesn’t know which database to talk to. So your next step is to configure it to point to your SQL database server. Since you might have several of these, your ODBC system lets you add as many configurations as you want. Each configuration is called a Data Source Name, or DSN. This funny name stems from the fact that the DSN is like a name for your data source. FileMaker will use that name to refer to the particular configuration. That way, you can change the configuration later and FileMaker won’t mind. (For example, if you move your database server, or rename the database itself.)\nThese three pieces—the database server, the ODBC driver, and the DSN—come together to give your FileMaker database direct access to the back end SQL database. The rest of this article will focus on how to set up the DSN and make the connection in FileMaker.\nCreating a DSN The DSN setup process is entirely different from Mac OS X to Windows. So skip ahead to the section that is right for you.\nCreating a DSN on Windows You manage your ODBC data sources in the Administrative Tools control panel. Getting there varies from one version of windows to the next. But you start by choosing Start → Control Panel.\nIf you use Windows Vista, look for a category called System and Maintenance. Open it up and click the link for Administrative Tools. If you don’t see System and Maintenance, you will instead find an Administrative Tools icon right in the Control Panel window. Open it now.\nIf you use Windows XP, look for a category called Performance and Maintenance. Open it up and click the link for Administrative Tools. If you don’t see the Performance and Maintenance category, look for an Administrative Tools icon in the Control Panel window itself. Either way, open Administrative Tools now.\nOnce you’ve opened the Administrative Tools window, look for something called Data Sources. This is where you configure data sources. It looks a heck of a lot like this:\nThis is where you connect the ODBC system to your SQL databse server.\nTo create a DSN, first switch to the System tab (FileMaker only works with so-called System DSN’s). Then click Add. You’ll see a list of all the ODBC drivers installed on your computer. Find the driver you installed in the list, select it, and click Finish. Setup from this point forward is the same on Mac and Windows, so skip ahead to Configuring your DSN below.\nCreating a DSN on Mac OS X On Mac OS X, you manage your ODBC data sources in an application called ODBC Administrator. You can find it in the Utilities folder, which itself is in your Applications folder. Open it, and you’ll see something like this:\nBefore you can do anything in this program, you need to unlock it. Click the inconspicuous padlock icon in the bottom left-hand corner (you may have to enter an Administrator password). Then click Add. You’ll be asked to select an ODBC driver from a list. Pick the one you want, then click OK. In the window that pops up, make sure you choose System when asked to pick a DSN type.\nConfiguring your DSN At this point, you have created a DSN, but you haven’t finished configuring it. The exact steps for configuration vary from driver to driver (and platform to platform), but in general, you’ll need to provide this information:\nThe host name or address of the SQL database server. The username and password needed to connect to the database. For some database systems, the name of the database you’ll be connecting to. You may be asked to provide other information, but you can usually accept the answers it suggests. When you get to the last screenful of options, you’ll get the chance to test the connection. Click this button and make sure it tells you the test was successful. This is how you know you’ve made the right choices.\nAccessing a DSN in FileMaker You have just two steps left. First, you need to tell FileMaker about the DSN you created. Then you’re ready to start accessing tables and defining relationships.\nCreate an external data source Thankfully, the hard part is over. Now you just need to tell FileMaker about your DSN, and point-and-click your way to SQL database bliss. First, open your FileMaker database. Then choose File → Manage → External Data Sources. The new Edit Data Source dialog box appears. Give your data source a name, and turn on the ODBC radio button. When you do, the window will instantly change to look like this:\nNow you\u0026rsquo;re ready to tell FileMaker about your DSN.\nNext, click the Specify button across the window from DSN. FileMaker shows you a list of system DSNs on your computer. Choose the one you want, then click OK.\nNext, you need to decide how your usernames and passwords will be handled. If you choose “Prompt user for user name and password,” FileMaker will ask the user of your FileMaker database to enter a SQL database username and password. If that’s not your cup of tea, you can choose “Specify user name and password” instead, and key in the username and password to use. FileMaker will then automatically log in to the SQL database with these credentials when it needs to access the data.\nTip: Both the “User name” and Password boxes have a Specify button beside them. You can use a FileMaker calculation to derive the exact values if necessary. The last section in this window is a bit of an enigma. These settings let you control which tables FileMaker is willing to show you when you start to work with this data source. Normally, you see all tables accessible through the DSN. If you want to see Views (which are kind of like stored queries that provide specialized results), turn on the Views checkbox under Filter by Type. Some database systems have special tables created by the system itself. To see these, turn on “System tables.”\nYou can also filter using some confusing criteria called “Catalog name,” and “Schema name.” The exact meaning of these boxes varies from one database system to the next. Here are the details:\nFor Oracle:\nCatalog: Not used Schema: The name of the user who owns the tables For Microsoft SQL Server:\nCatalog: The name of the database Schema: The name of the collection of tables/views/etc For MySQL:\nCatalog: Not used Schema: The name of the user who owns the tables To limit FileMaker to only the tables in a particular “catalog,” whatever that means to your database, enter the appropriate name in the “Catalog name” box.\nFinally, you can restrict FileMaker to just one table by typing the table name in the same-named box.\nNote: You might wonder why you should bother restricting the tables in these ways. The answer is speed. The less FileMaker has to wade through to do its job, the faster it will run. Once you’re finished making choices, click OK. You now have a link between FileMaker and your SQL database.\nAccessing a table through ESS With the external data source defined, FileMaker now shows you SQL tables just like it would tables from another FileMaker Pro database. Choose File → Manage → Database and switch to the Relationships tab. Then click the Add Table button. In the window that pops up, choose your new external data source from the Data Source pop-up menu. After a short pause, you should see a list of available tables. Choose one and click OK.\nThe SQL table appears on your relationships graph just like any other table. You can drag lines to and from it to create relationships. When you leave the Manage Database window, you can make new layouts based on this table. You can perform finds using find mode, add new records, delete records, and edit the records that are there. In short, this table feels pretty normal.\nThere are many nuances to ESS development that you’ll need to familiarize yourself with as you go along. We’ll cover using ESS in a future article. But hopefully at this point you’ve got ESS up and running, and you’re ready to experiment.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/sfr/getting-started-with-external-sql-sources/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Getting Started with External SQL Sources"},{"content":"There’s a lively discussion on the TechNet mailing list right now about the pros and cons of FileMaker Pro’s Object Grids feature. [ed: TechNet is now Claris Community. The link has been updated accordingly.] This is certainly an opinionated discussion, and there is clearly no “right” way. A lot of people find Object Grids annoying because it makes it harder to line things up sometimes. Here’s a quick tip to help get Object Grids to behave themselves.\nI love Object Grids, and leave them on almost all the time, but I don’t think I’d feel this way without the little trick explained here.\nFirst, an explanation. The name of this feature — Object Grids — is probably more telling than you realize (note the plural). When you get right down to it, there is no grid on the FileMaker Layout. To me, “grid” implies some consistent system of invisible lines that span the entire layout. Something like this:\nYou\u0026rsquo;d be forgiven for thinking FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s Object Grids worked (conceptually) like this. But they don\u0026rsquo;t.\nIf you’re like me, you might assume that when you turn on Object Grids, FileMaker starts snapping your objects to a grid like this. But it doesn’t work that way. There is no layout-wide grid, invisible or otherwise. When you turn on Object Grids, FileMaker really just makes objects you drag around move in 6-pixel steps. Essentially, every object is on its own grid, and if you’re lucky, the objects you’re trying to line up will have the same grid. But there’s a chance they won’t.\nTip: Although the default grid spacing in FileMaker is 6 pixels, you can actually configure it yourself. Just visit Layout mode, then choose Layouts → Set Rulers. Normally, when you create a new object, duplicate an existing one, or paste one in while Object Grids is on, FileMaker is careful to keep them on a consistent grid that starts at position (0,0) on the layout. But sometimes an object gets off the normal grid, and on to a grid of its own. Maybe it was created or moved when Object Grids was turned off. Or perhaps you used the arrow keys to nudge the object a little at some point in its life. Whatever the reason, once it is off the grid, it won’t line up right anymore as you drag it around. This is especially problematic when you first created a layout with Object Grids turned off, and are trying to start using it.\nThe trick is to find a way to quickly re-align an object to some consistent grid used by most objects. And it turns out there is a way that is both quick and easy: Just drag the object into the top-left corner of the layout. When you do, FileMaker will abandon the gird and let the object land right in the corner, at position (0,0). Now, just drag it back where it belongs. As you do, it will move in 6 pixel chunks — on the same grid as everything else.\nNote that you have to actually drop the object in the corner. It won’t work to move it to the corner and back in one sweeping drag. Instead, drag it to the corner, drop it, pick it back up again, and drag it back.\nThis short video shows the technique in action. The first object I drag is already on the grid, and you can see it aligns nicely. The second box seems to have found its own center, so to speak. Using the drag-to-the-corner technique, I quickly get it back on the normal grid.\nSome quick mouse-work can get a mis-aligned object back on the standard grid.\nIf you’re switching from a free-form layout to one that works well with Object Grids, you may have to do this little song and dance with every object on your layout. But if you’re been using Object Grids all along, this becomes something you do every now and again to get an object back in line. I find this technique makes using Object Grids a pleasure. I can focus on the big picture, and let FileMaker worry about the pixels.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/sfr/making-filemaker-object-girds-behave/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Making FileMaker Object Grids Behave"},{"content":"This is a quickie: If you were using the beta release of the PHP API for FileMaker, there are some things you should know.\nFirst, the beta API expires in October 7th, 2007. If you have a live site using the API, you must update to FileMaker 9 and the new API before then or your site will stop working. Now is the time to make the switch, before you have to do it in a pinch.\nSecond, there are some differences between the beta API and the final API which you may need to address. The change that affected me most is new behavior in the getField() method of the Record object. In at least some versions of the beta api, this method returned the raw field data unchanged. But in the final API, it will “html encode” special characters in the field. So if you have, for instance, a \u0026lt; in the field, the API will turn it in to \u0026amp;lt; so that it shows as a proper less-than-sign on the rendered page.\nThis is a good change because it makes it less likely you’ll build fragile pages. But it breaks in one common case: when you have HTML in your fields that you want to render. In many situations, I allow users to enter formatted data in a FileMaker field (custom sizes, fonts, and point sizes). I then use the GetAsCss() function to convert this text to html-marked-up code that preserves the formatting. In this situation, I want the actual HTML to render on the page, instead of being escaped.\nWarning: [ed: I can\u0026rsquo;t believe I didn\u0026rsquo;t point this out when this was originally posted, but please note: unencoded HTML can be dangerous. It can expose you to CSRF attacks. If you do what is described in this article, make absolutely certain the HTML coming from the database can be trusted. Never ever ever do this with data in fields that was originally collected from some public web form or other source not under your control.] In this situation, you need to switch to the getFieldUnencoded() function in the PHP API. Just change getField to getFieldUnencoded. The object references and parameters are all the same.\nNote: I did not keep up on the PHP API betas as well as I should have. It is possible this change (and others) came in various beta releases, which I never bothered to test. That is very much my own problem, but I suspect there are others out there in the same boat. I should stress that this is a good change to the API. And it is pretty trivial to find the places in your code where you really want un-encoded output and fix them.\nIf you discover other gotchas that need to be fixed, post them in the comments below. I have converted one site successfully to the new API, and it only took a couple hours to do everything.\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/sfr/migrating-from-the-beta-filemaker-php-api/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Migrating from the Beta FileMaker PHP API"},{"content":"Today’s Find mode article is short-and-sweet. If you ever feel it would be easier to tell FileMaker what you don’t want it to find, the Omit checkbox is your friend. In fact, you can use this esoteric Find mode widget to create incredibly complex queries that target exactly what you want.\nThis article is part of our series on Find mode. Click here to visit the first in the series, which links to all the others. Normally, Find mode is all about telling FileMaker what you want: Everyone named Bob, or every shipment to Wisconsin. But sometimes there’s no concise way to articulate what you want. Imagine, for example, you need to send a letter to the parent of each student who doesn’t have an extracurricular activity. You know how to find the ones who do (just check the “Extracurricular Activities” check box in Find mode). But how do you tell FileMaker to find the folks who don’t have this box checked?\nThe answer, my friend, is Omit. First, describe what you’re not looking for. Switch to Find mode and check that Extracurricular box, for instance. But before you actually perform the find (by pressing Enter or clicking the Find button), turn on the Omit checkbox in the status area. You can see it here:\nOmit. It\u0026rsquo;s been hiding there all along.\nNow, when you perform the find, FileMaker will find everything but what matches your find request. Put another way, it omits every matching record from the found set.\nHere’s another example: Suppose you want to find everybody who is not in Arizona or California. You know how to create multiple requests, so you could list out all 48 other states, each in its own find request. But that sure sounds like a lot of work.\nInstead, do a find with just two find requests: Put Arizona in the State field in one request, and California in the other. Also, make sure you turn on the Omit checkbox for each request. (Go to the first request, turn on the Omit checkbox, then navigate to the second request and turn it on again.) Now FileMaker will go through the records in the database, and omit any in California and Arizona. Whatever’s left over will be your new found set.\nMixing Request Types It may not be obvious at first, but you can mix requests with and without Omit in the same find. To understand how this works, think about it this way:\nFileMaker starts with every record in the found set. If your first request has Omit turned on, it throws out every matching record. If the request does not Omit, FileMaker instead finds each matching record. It then moves on to the next find request. If this one should Omit, it looks in the records it found in step 2, and tosses out any that match. Otherwise, it looks through all the records in the database and adds any new ones it finds to the found set. Step 3 repeats for each additional request. As you have probably guessed, order is important when you start adding omit requests. If an omit request tosses a record out of the found set, it might be added back in by another request later in the list. Likewise, a record might be found by one request, only to be tossed out by an omit request later. In an argument about a particular record, the last request always wins.\nSo for example, you might want to find everybody who has ordered from you in the last three weeks who does not live in Alaska or Hawaii. You can do this with three requests:\nPut an appropriate date range (like 6/1/2007…) in the related Order Date field. Create a new request, turn on Omit, and put Alaska in the State field. Create a third request, turn on Omit again, and put Hawaii in the State field. When you perform this find, FileMaker first finds everybody who has ordered recently. From that list, it then omits anyone in Alaska. Finally, it kicks out the folks from Hawaii. You’re left with exactly the records you wanted.\nMastering Omit can make the seemingly impossible suddenly easy.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/sfr/the-secret-life-of-find-mode-omit/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"The Secret Life of Find Mode: Omit"},{"content":"FileMaker has some pretty powerful reporting tools. You can decorate your layouts any way you see fit, control which record show, in what order, and with any particular fields arranged to your liking. You can even summarize your data in numerous ways to produce totals, subtotals, and other aggregate analysis. But until FileMaker 9, there has been one glaring restriction: A report can only show records from one table. If you want to show new products on one page, and new customers on the next, you\u0026rsquo;re out of luck. Of course you can just create two reports, and print them back to back. But that is an imperfect solution:\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re in a busy office, other print jobs can get mixed up with yours, and you\u0026rsquo;ll have to reassemble your multi-part report by hand.\nEven more significant, people often don\u0026rsquo;t want paper anymore. Since version 8, FileMaker has had excellent PDF support, so you can take your beautiful reports digital. View them on screen, store them on the file server, and email them to your colleagues. But if your report is in several parts, you had to create different PDFs for each one. Yuck.\nAppend to PDF FileMaker 9 has a new, almost hidden feature called \u0026ldquo;Append to PDF.\u0026rdquo; It is only available in ScriptMaker, so you\u0026rsquo;ll have to write a script to take advantage of it. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, though — this article will show you everything you need to know.\nWhen your script creates a PDF, you can turn on the new \u0026ldquo;Append to existing PDF\u0026rdquo; checkbox (it shows up when you use the \u0026ldquo;Save Records as PDF\u0026rdquo; script step). With this option turned on, if you save the PDF in the same folder and with the same name as an existing PDF file on your hard drive, FileMaker doesn\u0026rsquo;t replace that PDF. Instead, it adds pages from this new report to the end of it. When it\u0026rsquo;s done, your existing PDF file has everything it had before, plus all the pages from your new report.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s basically it. The concept is very simple. Now your job is to put all the pieces together.\nACME Widgets and More Let\u0026rsquo;s do a little visualization. You are a FileMaker developer working for a company called ACME Widgets and More. ACME sells stuff, and they\u0026rsquo;ve asked you to give them a powerful new report. It will show important recap information about the previous week. They would like to see every new customer, along with how much they have ordered. They also want to see every product that sold in the last week, compared to the week before. Finally, they want an analysis of sales across all product categories.\nYou already have reports that do these things. But they want them in the inboxes of each executive every monday morning, as a nicely formatted PDF.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no reasonable way to produce a report like this with just one layout since each report comes from a different table. And since you already have the various reports, it would be a shame to recreate them all anyway. So instead, you\u0026rsquo;ll use Append to PDF to assemble all three reports in one single PDF file. For good measure, you\u0026rsquo;ll also add a nice cover sheet to the report. And then, once the big wigs see the awesome report, you\u0026rsquo;ll enjoy your bonus in the Bahamas. Thank you, FileMaker.\nFigure 1You already have the reports. You just need to put a cover sheet on them and package them all together. This could be an all-day job of printing, collating, and stapling every Monday. But with Append to PDF you can script the entire process.\nGetting Started The basis of your script is really very simple:\nGo to the appropriate layout for the first page or pages. Perform any appropriate finds, sorts, and so forth. Save the report as a PDF Go to the next layout Rinse. Repeat. Your first task is to output the first page or pages of the report. The finding and sorting is up to you. But once you have what you want on the screen, add the Save Records as PDF script step to your script.\nWhen you use this script step, you have two choices for where the PDF is saved, and what it is called. You can either hard-code a file path (by turning on the \u0026ldquo;Specify output file\u0026rdquo; checkbox) or you can leave this option off and let your user decide where to save. Many PDF generating scripts choose the latter option so the script doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to know where the file should go.\nBut your script is going to run Save Records as PDF several times. You certainly don\u0026rsquo;t want your user to have to deal with the Save As dialog box repeatedly while the report runs. So in this case, you should specify the output file location in the script.\nWorking With File Paths Hard-coding the path for the PDF file is often easier said than done. If you\u0026rsquo;re the only user of your database, then it\u0026rsquo;s a no-brainer. Just click Specify, then Add File and choose an appropriate name and location for the file. But chances are the path you choose will be unique to you: It will have your system account name in it, and may refer to folders that are only on your computer.\nIf you have other users, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to come up with some way to make the path more generic. Luckily, if you have FileMaker Pro Advanced (the more powerful version of FileMaker), it\u0026rsquo;s a breeze.\nIn addition to hard-coded file paths, FileMaker Pro Advanced can use a \u0026ldquo;variable\u0026rdquo; for the destination of an exported file, including a PDF. First, you put the path you want in the variable, then you refer to the variable when FileMaker asks for a path.\nUsing this technique, you can make the exact path change appropriately for each user. In fact, this simple calculation will give you a path that saves the file on the user\u0026rsquo;s desktop:\n\u0026#34;file:\u0026#34; \u0026amp; Get(DesktopPath) \u0026amp; \u0026#34;acme_weekly_report.pdf\u0026#34; Here\u0026rsquo;s how you tie it all together:\nAdd the Set Variable script step to your script.\nThis script step is only available in FileMaker Pro Advanced. With the new step selected, click the Specify button in the bottom-right corner of the Edit Script window.\nFileMaker pops up the Set Variable Options dialog box. Here, you can give your variable a name and a value. In the Name box, enter $path.\nBy starting your variable name with a dollar sign, you\u0026rsquo;re telling FileMaker you want this variable to live for the duration of your script. Click the Specify button next to the Value box (Not the one by the Repetition box).\nFileMaker\u0026rsquo;s standard Specify Calculation dialog box appears. You can use any formula you want here, but this is a good choice:\n\u0026#34;file:\u0026#34; \u0026amp; Get(DesktopPath) \u0026amp; \u0026#34;acme_weekly_report.pdf\u0026#34; It tells FileMaker you want a file called \u0026ldquo;acme_weekly_report.pdf\u0026rdquo; on the user\u0026rsquo;s desktop.\nClick OK, then OK again to get back to the Edit Script window.\nNow you are ready to use your variable. Add the Save Records as PDF script step to your script, then turn on its \u0026ldquo;Specify output file\u0026rdquo; checkbox.\nThe Specify Output File dialog box appears. Resist the temptation to click the Add File button. This time you won\u0026rsquo;t be choosing a file that way. In the big Output File Path List box, type $path.\nFileMaker will look at this variable when the script runs and use its value as the path for the PDF. You can define this variable once at the top of the script, then use it in every Save Records as PDF step so you\u0026rsquo;ll be sure they all refer to exactly the same file.\nIn addition to a fixed file location, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to turn on the \u0026ldquo;Perform without dialog\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Specify options\u0026rdquo; checkboxes for the Save Records as PDF script step. These setting ensure your user won\u0026rsquo;t be pestered with dialog boxes as the report is assembled. But don\u0026rsquo;t turn on \u0026ldquo;Append to existing PDF\u0026rdquo; for this step. You\u0026rsquo;ll use that feature on the next section.\nFor now, when you turn on \u0026ldquo;Specify options,\u0026rdquo; just make sure \u0026ldquo;Records being browsed\u0026rdquo; is selected in the Save pop-up menu, then click OK. We will revisit the advanced PDF options shortly.\nAt this point, your script might look something like Figure 2.\nFigure 2This script isn\u0026rsquo;t all that earth shattering, but its the start of a powerful report. In this case, it goes to a special layout that shows a nice cover page, and sends that layout to a PDF on the user\u0026rsquo;s desktop. This version of the script uses variables, which requires FileMaker Pro Advanced. If you only have the regular version of FileMaker Pro, just hard-code a file name and location and leave out the Set Variable step.\nAppending to an Existing PDF The next steps are almost identical to the last. Go to a layout, do your finds and sorts, and save as PDF. You\u0026rsquo;ll make only one small change: When you add the Save Records as PDF step to your script, turn on its new \u0026ldquo;Append to existing PDF\u0026rdquo; checkbox (Figure 3). Since you\u0026rsquo;re using the same path for the output file, FileMaker will find the PDF you created in the first part of the script and add pages to it.\nFigure 3See that little checkbox called \u0026ldquo;Append to existing PDF?\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s it. That\u0026rsquo;s the new feature in FileMaker Pro 9. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t look like much, but as you\u0026rsquo;re finding out right now, it packs a lot of power.\nYour complex report can have as many parts as you want. Just keep on calling Save Records as PDF, and make sure \u0026ldquo;Append to existing PDF\u0026rdquo; is turned on each time. Figure 4 shows a more complete script.\nFigure 4This script produces a single PDF from four different layouts. All the work of changing layouts and finding records is tucked away in subscripts. You only need to concern yourself with the four separate steps that save PDFs. Notice that the first Save Records as PDF step does not have the \u0026ldquo;Append\u0026rdquo; option turned on. It creates the initial PDF file (replacing any older version that might be there). The others then append to that one.\nFixing Page Numbers If you have a script like the one in Figure 4, you\u0026rsquo;re off to a good start, but you\u0026rsquo;re not done yet. Your complex report has one significant problem: the page numbers are out of whack. Suppose the cover page is (duh) one page. Then the next report is three pages. Then two more pages, and finally four more pages. Your overall report would then be 1 + 3 + 2 + 4 = 10 pages. But if you show page numbers on the reports themselves, they won\u0026rsquo;t count properly. FileMaker numbers each page starting at one for each Save Records as PDF step, so you wind up with page numbers like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4. Chances are that\u0026rsquo;s not what you had in mind.\nTo combat this problem, the Save Records as PDF step lets you tell it what page number to start with. Just select one of these steps, click the Specify button next to \u0026ldquo;Specify options,\u0026rdquo; then click Options. FileMaker shows you the PDF Options dialog box, which you can also see in Figure 5.\nFigure 5The PDF Options dialog box lets you enter all kinds of things. Most of this stuff doesn\u0026rsquo;t do much (Title, Subject, Author, and Keywrods, for instance, just show up in an obscure info window in your PDF program). But the \u0026ldquo;Number pages from\u0026rdquo; box holds the key to proper page numbering.\nYou can put any number you want in the \u0026ldquo;Number pages from\u0026rdquo; box. So if you know your first report is just one page, you can tell the second PDF (the one you\u0026rsquo;re appending to the first) to start numbering with page 2.\nBut usually, you don\u0026rsquo;t know ahead of time how man pages your report will be. When that\u0026rsquo;s the case, you have to get creative. The only way to know how many pages a printed (or PDFed) report will be is to switch to Preview mode, go to the last page, and see for yourself. You can do all this in your script, keeping the running page count in a variable (or a global field if you don\u0026rsquo;t have FileMaker Pro Advanced).\nRemember that you need to know the page count for a section after you\u0026rsquo;ve added it to the PDF, so you can start the numbering on the next section properly. You need to start your page numbering at 1. So add a line like this to the top of your script:\nSet Variable [ $page ; 1 ] You\u0026rsquo;ll add to this variable every time you append more pages to the PDF so it always knows how many pages you\u0026rsquo;ve used so far. After your first Save Records as PDF script step, add these lines to your script:\nEnter Preview Mode [] Go to Record/Request/Page [ Last ] Set Variable [ $page ; $page + Get(PageNumber) ] Enter Browse Mode [] These four lines of code grab the last page number from the report you just printed and add it to the $page variable.\nFinally, select the next Save Records as PDF script step and click the Specify box next to \u0026ldquo;Specify options\u0026rdquo;. In the PDF Options dialog box (Figure 5), put $page in the \u0026ldquo;Number pages from\u0026rdquo; box.\nRepeat these for each additional section, so that every time you append, your starting page number is based on the variable, and after every section, you update the $page variable appropriately.\nWith these steps in place, your complex report now has perfect page numbers.\nThe Security Gotcha As you work with PDFs, you may be tempted by the Security tab in the PDF Options dialog box. It offers up all kinds of password protection powers for your PDF. You can, for instance, require a password to print the PDF, or copy text from it. You can also restrict \u0026ldquo;editing,\u0026rdquo; which may sound a little intriguing since you can\u0026rsquo;t normally edit a PDF file anyway. With the right software, though, you can edit PDF files. In fact, when FileMaker appends pages to an existing PDF file, it is editing that file. And that\u0026rsquo;s the rub: FileMaker can\u0026rsquo;t append pages to a PDF that doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow editing.\nIf you turn on security restrictions for your PDF, make sure you choose either \u0026ldquo;Inserting, deleting, and rotating pages\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Any except extracting pages\u0026rdquo; from the Editing pop-up menu for your first Save Records as PDF script step. Otherwise, FileMaker won\u0026rsquo;t be able to append pages later (and you\u0026rsquo;ll get an appropriate \u0026ldquo;Access denied\u0026rdquo; error message if you try).\nYou might be tempted to create the PDF unrestricted, then turn on the security settings as you append the last pages to the PDF. Alas, this won\u0026rsquo;t work. The security settings are ignored when you\u0026rsquo;re appending to a PDF that already exists. You simply can\u0026rsquo;t restrict editing this way if you want to use the Append to PDF feature.\nFinishing Touches Your original goal was to email a nicely formatted report to the honchos every Monday. FileMaker has had the ability to email a PDF file since version 8. And you can use this feature here too. The trick is to select your options for the last Save Records as PDF step. If you turn on \u0026ldquo;Create email with file as attachment\u0026rdquo; (or \u0026ldquo;Automatically open file\u0026rdquo;) before you\u0026rsquo;re adding the last section, you\u0026rsquo;ll end up sending an incomplete report.\nUsing the new Append to PDF feature, you can now create stand-alone reports that are much more complex than was ever possible before. Using the techniques here, you can add as many sections as you want to the PDF. And with all the data bundled together in one file, it\u0026rsquo;s a breeze to back it up, store it for later, print it out, or send it to someone else.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/advisor/assemble-multi-part-reports-with-filemaker-pro/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Assemble Multi-Part Reports with FileMaker Pro 9"},{"content":"Did you know that if you shift-click on a field formatted as radio buttons, you can select more than one choice? Even if you don’t know this, chances are some day some user will figure it out. Yuck. Here’s a short-but-sweet technique to deal with the problem. And you’ll see how to apply the same concept to do some cool stuff.\nJust in case you think I’m foolin’, here’s a picture. You’re definitely not supposed to be able to do this:\nTypically you would use radion buttons to force a single selection from several choices, but FileMaker actually allows the user to select more than one with the Shift key.\nWhere One Is Expected, Two Are Checked Before I show the solution, it might help if I remind you how radio buttons (and checkboxes) work in FileMaker. If you turn on just “Male” in the database above, the Gender field will have this in it:\nMale Makes sense. If you turn on both Male and Female, FileMaker needs to figure out how to put two values in one field. It accomplishes the seemingly impossible by putting each value on its own line. So under the hood, the field has this in it:\nMale Female Every time you check off a new item, it gets added to the end of the list.\nNote: In case it wasn’t obvious up top, you can do this with any field that is formatted as a radio button. Just hold down the Shift key and start clicking. Each item you click one it turns on — and the other items don’t turn off. Of course if you wanted this kind of behavior, you would have chosen the Checkbox style instead. So chances are you don’t want this to happen. Stop the Madness Of course, there are probably lots of ways to keep your users from doing this. You could, for instance, use a Validation calculation. But that just gets FileMaker to bark at your user when they make a mistake. I always favor preventing a mistake to complaining about one after it has happened. So how can we stop the user from choosing the second item in the firs place?\nThe trick is to use an Auto-Enter calculation. Remember that when a second item is selected, it is added to the end of the list. FileMaker doesn’t turn off the other selected items, but you can. Just add this Auto-Enter calculation to the field you want to protect:\nGetValue(Self; ValueCount(Self)) Also, make sure you turn off the “Do not replace existing value (if any)” checkbox for this Auto-Enter calculation. This formula tells FileMaker to grab the last value in the field and throw out all the rest. And by value FileMaker means “line.”\nNote: If you’re not using FileMaker Pro 9 or later, you won’t be able to use the fantastic Self function shown here. Instead, just change Self to the name of the field you’re trying to protect against double-entry. Likewise, if you’re not using FileMaker Pro 8 or later, you won’t be able to use the GetValue function. In that case you’ll have to use RightValues instead, and make sure to remove the trailing carriage return from its result. When your user surreptitiously Shift-clicks the radio button, FileMaker adds their choice to the end of the list. Then the Auto-Enter calc kicks in. It keeps that last line (the one just clicked) and tosses out all the rest. The result is a radio button that works just like they didn’t have the Shift key down.\nMore Tricks with Values You can extend this technique in at least one interesting way. Suppose you have a field formatted as a checkbox set on your layout. Normally, of course, this means the user can pick as many items as they want. But your instructions are to “choose three” from the list. Or ten. Or two. Or whatever makes your socks go up and down.\nThere are actually two different calculations that will help with this. Here’s the first:\nLet ( vals = RightValues(Self, 3), Left(vals, Length(vals) – 1 ) ) This calculation works a lot like the radio button version above. It keeps the last three and tosses out the oldest. In this case, though, since we want several values, we can’t use the GetValue function. Instead, we use RightValues to grab the last three. RightValues always tacks a carriage return on the end of the line, so we have to get rid of it to keep things clean. That’s what the whole Left(vals, Length(vals) – 1)) thing is all about.\nHere’s how it looks in action:\nThe user can click as many checkboxes as they want, but only the three most recent stay checked.\nBecause the calculation keeps the last three values, you can keep clicking as much as you want. FileMaker leaves the last three items checked, and clears the X on the oldest as you go.\nIf you use this calculation instead:\nLet ( vals = LeftValues(Self, 3), Left(vals, Length(vals) – 1 ) ) Then FileMaker keeps the first three values. When you try to click a fourth, it simply refuses to accept it. (Truthfully, it accepts it, updates the field, then promptly removes it because of the Auto-Enter calculation, but from the user’s perspective, it simply won’t allow a fourth choice.) You can see this version in the flesh here:\nIn this version, any attempt by the user to select more than three is simply rejected.\nThese techniques can help prevent bad data entry, and make your database more usable. Let us know if you discover any other interesting applications.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/sfr/limiting-checkbox-and-radio-button-choices/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Limiting Checkbox and Radio Button Choices"},{"content":"If you have a relational database (one with several connected tables) and you do any scripting at all, you’ll almost certainly ask yourself a question at some point: How can I tell if the record I’m on has related records? This article explains the scenarios you may run in to, and how best to deal with them.\nBefore I start pontificating, let’s set up a scenario. I have the simplest of all possible relational databases. The Relationships tab of my Manage Database window looks a lot like this:\nThe simplest of all possible relational databases has two tables and one join.\nI’ve got a Products table, and a related Parts table. Some products have no parts, some have a few, and some have hundreds. We’ll use this hypothetical example for the rest of the article.\nSafely Processing Related Records When you’re scripting, you often bump in to a scenario where you need to know if you have related records or not. Maybe your script is about to jump to the Parts related to a Product and do something to them:\nGo to Layout [Products] Go to Related Record [From Table: “Parts”; Using Layout: “Parts List”] Go to Record/Request/Page [First] Loop // do something here Go to Record/Request/Page [Next; Exit After Last] End Loop This script looks pretty solid: It goes to the set of related Parts records, jumps to the first in the list, then loops through them, doing “something” to each one. But it has a pretty serious bug:\nIf there are no related parts records, it will loop through all the product records in your found set, doing goodness only knows what to them.\nThat sounds like a FileMaker bug at first, but it isn’t. Here’s what’s happening: Since this product has no related parts, the second line in your script (Go to Related Record) will fail. It will fail quietly, though. If you turn on FileMaker Pro Advanced 9’s Script Debugger, switch on “Pause on Error”, and run the script, it will pause on that line and inform you that error number 101 has occurred. Error 101, as luck would have it, means “Record is missing.” Since the step failed, it doesn’t do anything, and your script runs as though the Go to Related Record step weren’t there at all. Ick.\nYou can probably dream up a lot of ways to deal with this problem. Perhaps the most straight forward is to simply add a little error checking:\nGo to Layout [Products] Go to Related Record [From Table: “Parts”; Using Layout: “Parts List”] If [Get(LastError) = 0] Go to Record/Request/Page [First] Loop // do something here Go to Record/Request/Page [Next; Exit After Last] End Loop End If Now, if the Go to Related Record step fails (for any reason), your script is smart enough to avoid the loop. I use this method in most cases because it is absolutely safe. This is especially important if the stuff in the loop is destructive (like if it changes data or—gasp—deletes records).\nDetecting Related Records in other Situations The sample above only applies to one case: Using the Go to Related Record script step in a script. But there are lots of other scenarios where you might want to find out if you have related records. For example, suppose you want to turn the “Add Part” button red when there are no related records, so your users are irresistibly attracted to it. Or perhaps you have an unstored calculation field that shows the message, “No parts have been added yet.” when there are no related records. There are lots of reasons you want to find out, so how do you do it?\nA common approach is to count them. For instance, in a calculation field in the Products table, you might use a formula like this:\nIf ( Count(PARTS::ID) = 0 ; “You need to enter some parts.” ) This formula looks at the ID field in all the related Parts records. If the field value is not empty, it counts the record, so the result of the expression Count(PARTS::ID) is the number of related parts records that have an ID. Since every record has an ID, in practice this technique counts the related records.\nThis formula will work swimmingly, but it has a drawback: FileMaker has to do the counting. This isn’t such a big deal. After all, FileMaker is pretty speedy. But why put it through its paces if you don’t have to?\nHere is a version of the calculation that does exactly the same thing, with less work on FileMaker’s part:\nIf ( IsEmpty(PARTS::ID) ; “You need to enter some parts.” ) It may look a little counterintuitive, but if you scratch your head for a while, I think it will start to make sense. It says, “If the related Part ID field is empty, show the message.” But, you say, the ID field is never empty. Exactly. So if you look through the relationship at the ID field and it is empty, then there must not be a related record. Make sense?\nUsing IsEmpty() on a related field that is never really empty is a fast, sure-fire way to detect the absence of related records. It is faster than count, and completely fail safe.\nFAQ: Someone told me I should use IsValid() for this instead. Doesn’t that work too?\nThe IsValid() function is a little-known function in FileMaker’s calculation system whose purpose in life is twofold: First, it tells you when you have bogus (ie: invalid) data in number, date, time, and timestamp fields. For instance, you might import from an Excel spreadsheet, and somebody put “Next Tuesday” in the Date Due column. FileMaker will import this data happily (unless you have validation to prevent it), but “Next Tuesday” is not a valid date. It is, as they say, invalid. The IsValid() function can also detect a missing table, but that’s not the sort of thing you typically code for.\nFor whatever reason, although the FileMaker manual says nothing about it, IsValid() will also return false when you look at a related field and their are no related records. So some people use it for this purpose. But is wasn’t designed to be used that way, and the folks at FileMaker can’t promise it will always work that way. What’s more there’s a (small but real) chance you might actually have invalid data in a related field. If you use IsValid() it might return false because of actual invalid data rather than no-related-records. So it isn’t completely reliable. But IsEmpty will always work so long as you stick with a field that will never be empty. And the ID field in your table is a perfect candidate for this.\nHappy scripting 😄\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/sfr/detecting-related-records/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Detecting Related Records"},{"content":"Date values (and to a lesser extent, time values) are exceptionally common in database applications. And it isn’t at all unusual to want to ask you database interesting date-related questions, like “How many orders do we get on Tuesdays?” or “What was our total enrollment for the first quarter?” In fact, it is probably more common to look at ranges of dates than any particular date. Of course, if you’ve read our previous article on Find mode, you know how to find whole ranges of dates easily using find symbols. But FileMaker Pro’s Find mode has several date-specific tricks up its sleeve.

[ed: I mean, you could read the manual but I agree that is essentially the same thing as \u0026ldquo;nowhere\u0026rdquo;.]\nNote: All the techniques in this article will only work with FileMaker Pro 8.0 or later. If you’re using 7, you’ll have to skip this party. Abbreviate When you’re entering dates in Browse mode you have to follow FileMaker’s date rules to the tee. But in Find mode you can cut corners. To wit:\nIf you want to find every event scheduled for August, 2007, don’t bother with all this:\n8/1/2007…8/31/2007 You can just do this instead:\n8/2007 Likewise, if it’s the whole year you’re after, just do this:\n2007 FileMaker will find any date in 2007.\nThe same goes for time values. If you want to find orders that came in after lunch, use this:\n12pm… Note: The elipsis there is important. It means 12pm is the beginning of a range. A Slice in Time The examples above are really just time savers. You can accomplish any of them the long way with various find symbols and a lot of typing. But try this on for size: You want to find every order that was placed on a Tuesday. That’s a seriously hard find to do…or is it? Just put Tuesday in a date field in Find mode and FileMaker gives you just what you want. To save time, you can abbreviate instead: Tue.\nThis day-name power can be used with ranges too:\nMon…Fri That will find all the weekday sales.\nIf you need a more monthly perspective, you’re still in luck. You can find every trouble ticket that came in on a pay day:\n*/15/* That find will match the 15th of any month, on any year. In fact, you can use the * notation in any way that makes sense. If you’re looking for Christmas day clock-ins, try this search:\n12/25/* It will find Christmas no matter the year.\nFinally, if * is too liberal, you can use ranges in any segment of the date. This will find bookings between the 4th and 15th:\n3/{4…15}/2007 Of course, you can combine * and the {…} ranges as you see fit. How about finding every first quarter sale in history:\n{1…3}/*/* Times and Timestamps The same powers apply to time values. Each of these is perfectly valid:\n# fifteen minutes past the hour *:15 # closing time {3…4}:* pm And of course what applies to dates and times also applies to timestamps. Why not find every timeclock record from the fourth quarter that falls between 5:00 and 6:00 pm on a pay day?\n{10…12}/15/* 5pm Timestamp values are a little persnickety, though. If you use a day name (Monday or Mon, for instance) FileMaker has a habit of shoving the current date in the mix, which throws things off. To compensate, add */*/* after your day name, to insist on any date that falls on that day. For instance, why not dig up all the Friday afternoon early punch-outs [ed: Jeez this article is a cop. I regret this decision.]:\nFri */*/* {3…4}:* pm These tricks, however hidden, are amazingly powerful. If you don’t know they’re there, you can spend a lot of time and energy scripting and calculating your way around these sorts of queries.\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/sfr/the-secret-life-of-find-mode-dates-times/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"The Secret Life of Find Mode: Dates and Times"},{"content":"Once you’ve mastered multiple requests, you’re ready to move on to the next Find Mode gem: Find Symbols. Using these bits of punctuation, you can tell FileMaker, when it goes about matching records to your find criteria, to be a little more flexible, or a little more strict. In this article, you’ll learn about each one.\nThis article is part of our series on Find mode. Click here to visit the first in the series, which links to all the others. Find Symbols are special punctuation you type right in to Find mode. FileMaker doesn’t just match these symbols directly. Instead, they serve as hints to FileMaker about how you want things to match. Luckily, you don’t have to just know what these symbols are. You can see them all in the status area when you’re in Find mode:\nFileMaker helpfully shows you all the avaialble symbols. But the descriptions here are a little terse. No worry. Read on.\nThe Symbols pop-up menu lists every valid Find mode symbol, along with a description of what it does. Chances are you’ve used a few of these before, even if you didn’t know they were called Symbols. For instance, most FileMaker users know you can put something like this in a date field in Find mode:\n8/11/1976…12/29/2001 When you do, your found set will include all records whose date value is between August 11th 1976 and December 29th, 2001.\nThe Range Symbol As you just saw, the … symbol — better known as the “range” symbol — lets you specify a range of values to match. It isn’t limited to dates. You can provide a range of numbers in a number field:\n22…36 Or a range of times:\n9:00 AM…5:00 PM You can even provide a range in a text field:\nAdam…Bernard FileMaker thinks about text ranges alphabetically. In other words, if you put all your names in alphabetical order, the range above would include every name between Adam and Bernard.\nIt is important to remember that the range symbol is inclusive: A value that matches either end exactly will be included in the found set.\nTip: It’s a small concession, but if you’re keystroke-conscious, you can trim one . from your Range symbols. It is perfectly valid to use just two dots: 3..7 Comparison Symbols The next-most-common symbols are \u0026lt;, ≤, ≥, and \u0026gt;. These symbols are like the range symbol with only one end. For example, to find everyone born after Star Wars came out:\n\u0026gt;5/25/1977 These symbols are pretty self explanatory: “Greater than 5/25/1977.” Some people prefer using the range symbol instead of ≤ or ≥. For example, this will find every order placed after January first:\n1/1/2007… Note: On Mac OS X, the “less than or equal” symbol looks like this: ≤. On Windows, it looks like this instead: \u0026lt;=. But both versions have the exact same meaning. (And in fact, the Windows style symbol will work perfectly on the Mac too.) The same goes for \u0026ldquo;greater than or equal.\u0026rdquo; Exact Match One of the most useful symbols is =, or the \u0026ldquo;exact match\u0026rdquo; symbol. Normally, FileMaker is pretty forgiving about field matches when performing a find. For instance, if you put San in the City field, FileMaker will consider each of these a match:\nSan Francisco Santa Clara San Bernardino San Jose Rancho Santa Margarita …basically every city in California. If you want to be technical, FileMaker does a word-based prefix match, meaning if any word in the field starts with the value you type in your find request, FileMaker considers it a match (see \u0026ldquo;Rancho Santa Margarita\u0026rdquo; in the list above).\nThe \u0026ldquo;exact match\u0026rdquo; symbol lets you be more specific. If you use this find criterion:\n=San FileMaker will still match San Francisco but it won\u0026rsquo;t match Santa Clara. With =, it only matches whole words.\nField Content Match If you want to be even more specific, you can use the \u0026ldquo;field content match\u0026rdquo; symbol: ==. This little buddy tells FileMaker you know exactly what you\u0026rsquo;re looking for, and it only finds records where the entire field matches your find criterion exactly.\nFor example, if you did your San search this way:\n==San Then you\u0026rsquo;d only find people in the city of San. (More likely you\u0026rsquo;d find nothing, since San isn\u0026rsquo;t a city.) You would use this symbol when you are looking for something very specific and a normal search finds too many records.\nWildcards Going the other direction, sometimes you want FileMaker to be less restrictive. FileMaker has three so-called wildcard symbols (think Jokers Wild not Call of the Wild):\n*: zero or more characters @: one character #: one digit These symbols stand in for data in the field. For example, if you want Cities that end with \u0026ldquo;son\u0026rdquo; you can do a search like this:\n*son That search will find the mythical city of Son (sister to the city of San), as well as:\nTucson Wilson Orson Note: As soon as you add a wildcard symbol, FileMaker starts doing an exact match as well. In other words, the whole word prefix mumbo jumbo no longer applies. *son will not match Watsonville. The * symbol will match any number of letters or numbers. It will even match no characters (that’s why *son finds the city of Son). The @ symbol, on the other hand, matches exactly one character. Try a search like this:\nSant@ And FileMaker will find:\nSanta Clara Santo Domingo But it won’t find “Sant” because the @ symbol expects exactly one character (not zero or one).\nTip: Sometimes these symbols aren’t flexible enough. For example, you might want “one or more characters.” You can combine @ and * to get what you want: San@*. That criterion will find “San” followed by at least one character, and possibly more. If you want “zero or one character” your job gets a little tougher. Your best bet is to use two find requests. In the first, put =San and in the second, put San@. The first request will match every record with “San” and the second will match “Sans”, “Sand”, and “Sang.” Finally, the # symbol works like @ but is only matches a numerical digit. This find:\n## Will match only two-digit numbers.\nLiteral Text All these special symbols might leave you feeling a bit worried: What if you don’t want to discombobulate FileMaker’s finding. Instead, you actually want to find an @ sign? Believe it or not, another symbol comes to the rescue: The “literal text” symbol. Just put your punctuated find criteria in quotes:\n“mr_magoo@sixfriedrice.com” When FileMaker sees those quote marks, it dutifully ignores the symbols inside. In fact, this is just what you should do if you’re searching for an email address.\nIf @ means “any character” then what does it matter? The @ in that search will happily match the @ sign in the email address, won’t it?\nUnfortunately, no. The @ sign (when in regular field data) is not indexed. In other words, FileMaker tosses it out when it takes its speed-search notes about your records. So to FileMaker, the email address mr_magoo@sixfriedrice.com is really three words: mr, magoo, and sixfriedrice.com So there’s nothing in there for the @ symbol to match. You can prove this yourself: When you need to find an email address, just put a space in place of the @ sign. It will find without a hitch.\nDuplicates The most esoteric find symbol is !: the “duplicates” symbol. You don’t put this next to any text. Instead, you put it in a field all by itself in Find mode. FileMaker will then find every record that has duplicates in that field. In other words, if your database has two Andy’s and no other duplicate first names, if you perform a find with ! in the First Name field, FileMaker finds both Andy’s but leaves everyone else out. If you later add a second Vincenzo, it will find both Andy’s and both Vincenzo’s.\nTip: This helps you find duplicate records. If you want help getting rid of them, see this article. Today’s Date The // symbol is really just shorthand to save you some typing. (Truthfully, it is also useful when scripting, but we’ll get to that in a future article.) When you put // in a find request, FileMaker acts just like you had meticulously typed out today’s date. To find every invoice due today, just bounce to Find mode, pound // in the Due Date field, and press Enter.\nYou can, of course, combine this symbol with others:\n# find every invoice due after today \u0026gt;// # find every event between now and christmas //..12/25/2007 Invalid Date or Time The last symbol is ?. It’s another funny one. Sometimes (if you import data from some other system, or change field types) you might wind up with bogus data in your date field. For example, Microsoft Excel is glad to let you type “sometime next week” in a column that normally holds dates. If you then import this into a date field, FileMaker accepts it (what else is it going to do?) but considers the value invalid. Later, you can switch to Find mode, put ? in the date field, and perform the find. FileMaker finds every record with an invalid date like this.\nThe ? symbol works for time and timestamp fields as well.\nA Few Examples Find symbols are flexible and powerful. Chances are you’ll dream up ways to use them that I’ve never thought of. But here are a few examples that might come in handy:\nIf you have a Full Name field and you want to find everyone with an initial, try this:\n@ It will find exactly one character. Since periods aren’t indexed, it will find all of these:\nJ. R. R. Tolkien Charlotte A. Cavatica A. A. Milne To quickly find everything up to today, put this in a date field:\n..// Likewise, if you want everything today or later try this:\n//.. If you’re using our delete duplicates technique, you can make your script run faster if you find the duplicates first. Put ! in each of the match fields, and FileMaker will find only the records the script actually cares about.\nIf 37Signals is one of your customers, but you can’t remember if it’s 37signals or 73signals (or 737signals for that matter) search for this:\n#*signals We’ll see you soon for our next article on Find mode. Until then, enjoy your new found symbol knowledge.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/sfr/the-secret-life-of-find-mode-symbols/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"The Secret Life of Find Mode: Symbols"},{"content":"The show has officially started. I’m seeing faces I haven’t seen in ages and having a blast. Here’s a quick recap of the highlights of DevCon so far, from my perspective.\nThe Keynote The day began with the keynote presentation. Dominique started with the classic “Here’s what we’re doing” presentation. The biggest highlight was a slide showing strong growth of TechNet (vs. the old Associate FSA program). This is great news because it means more people are getting more involved in the greater FileMaker community.\nAnd by the way, we here at SFR love the FBA even if it didn’t rate its own slide in the presentation.\nAndy LeCates then gave a caffein-enfused demonstration of FileMaker 9’s new features. The highlight, without a doubt, was that he visited sixfriedrice.com when he demonstrated some Web Viewer features. We put him on our favorite-people list after seeing that.\nBill Heizer did a great demo of ESS. He correctly pointed out that he was showing us stuff we already know, since ESS makes working with SQL sources seem just like using ordinary FileMaker tables. It really drove home once again how cool and seamless this feature is.\nFinally, Kevin Nathanson delivered a 20 minute comedy routine about DevCon and the J. W. Marriot Resorts. With a little on the PHP Site Assistant thrown in for balance. It was a total riot and had everyone laughing. My favorite line: “Time of service will vary depending on the agility of the chicken.” I guess you had to be there.\nIn all seriousness, though, he showed some cool stuff with the PHP Site Assistant that I hadn’t internalized. It has a ton of flexibility. It is definitely worth a look whether you’re a PHP expert or a total newbie. It rocks.\nGetting to Know FileMaker Server Jesse and I attended Rosemary Tietge’s (pronounced tee-gee) session on FileMaker Server. Here’s the bits I found interesting:\nServer vs. Peer to Peer sharing isn’t about how many users you have. If you consider your application critical, you need Server, even if you only have a few users. It’s about reliability, stability, and flexibility. She said, “If you’re sharing some data with a colleague, peer to peer sharing is perfect. If you rely on your database, you need a server.” (Despite the quotation marks there, I’m paraphrasing…) I couldn’t agree more.\nShe also gave some great advice about setting up your server. She stressed the importance of real server-class hardware. Again, I agree 100%. This is super important.\nShe did a great overview of different single- and multi-machine deployment strategies for web publishing with FileMaker Server. Hopefully we can do an article in the near future about best practices here, because it is a point of confusion with a lot of users.\nFinally, Rosemary let us know that most FileMaker Server install problems happen on an improperly prepared server. She outlined the steps you must take to get your server ready for the upgrade:\nStop all FileMaker services (web publishing engines, database server, helper services…) Uninstall the Web Publishing Engine. Uninstall FileMaker Server. Apply all patches for your OS and web server. On OSX Server, disable the performance cache. On Windows Server, disable directory authentication Test your web server to be sure it still starts and works. Install the FileMaker Server 9 components. It was awesome to see this spelled out so clearly. Thanks, Rosemary!\nProduct Showcase It was crowded, so I didn’t see everybody I wanted. Here are the highlights:\nWeb Services Plug-in from FM::Nexus Vince Menanno from FM::Nexus demonstrated an amazing new plug-in. (For the sake of full disclosure, Vince is an old and dear friend. But his plug-in still rocks big time.) It’s called the Web Services plug-in, and — I kid you not — it can analyze a web service (using its .wsdl file) and dynamically install external functions in FileMaker for each of the services methods. In other words, it seamlessly bridges xml web services with FileMaker’s scripts and calculations with, like, zero effort.\nThis might not make sense to you, so I’ll explain it this way for now: Yesterday, you had to write tons of insanely complicated code and figure out all manner of oddities to use web services. Today you drop a file in a folder and you’re done. Seriously cool.\nSuperContainer Jesse and I watched Jesse Barnum from 360Works demonstrate their fantastic SuperContainer product. I’ve seen it before, but never taken the time to internalize how cool it is. With SuperContainer, you can solve a very common FileMaker problem. When you want to put images in a database, you have two choices:\nStore the images in the database, which makes file sizes huge. Store references to the image, then painfully deal with paths, mounted volumes, and platform issues. SuperContainer provides a really clever solution. It is a server you can run anywhere you want (like on your FileMaker Server computer, or on a separate image server). You then point a web viewer at the server. The web viewer shows a UI to upload, delete, preview, and download images. The pictures display right in the web viewer.\nIt is really slick. It is fast, easy, and you get total control over where your images are stored. I love it.\nSo far it’s a great show. We’ll be blogging again tomorrow about day 2.\nPS: If you’re here, come by the Visionary booth between 11:00 and 12:00 to ask Jesse or me any questions about FileMaker, web development, or anything else.\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/sfr/filemaker-devcon-2007-day-one/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"FileMaker DevCon 2007 Day One"},{"content":"I’m excited to let you all know that Jesse and I will be participating in a cool new dealio at DevCon. If you haven’t heard about it, here’s the scoop: Chris Kubica (author, developer, and all around FileMaker powerhouse), arranged for a special booth at DevCon to be staffed by reasonably good FileMaker folks like us. You can bring your problems, questions, and FileMaker challenges to the booth and get free advice. It’s called the FileMaker Genius Bar. I love the idea and hate the name.\nGeniuses are easy to spot and I am not one of them.\nTHIS JUST IN: It turns out this booth is actually called The FileMaker Visionary Bar™. I stand corrected. I still don’t like the name. I mean I am pretty visionary, no doubt about it. But Jesse? Come on… This is something I’ve always wanted to see at DevCon, and (what is it the teenagers like Jesse say these days?) “props” to Chris for putting it together. It is so much fun to sit down and work out FileMaker challenges with people from all over the world. It’s one of my favorite things to do.\nJesse and I will be manning the booth together during these time slots:\nMonday from 4pm to 5pm Tuesday from 11am to 12pm Wednesday from 11am to 12pm If you’ve got FileMaker questions you think we could help with, swing by for a visit.

FileMaker Server can automatically install plug-ins on the connecting FileMaker Pro clients as needed. This is very cool, but there are a few gotchas, which are explained here.\nNote: AutoUpdate has been around since Server 5.5, and everything here applies in general. But this article was written with FileMaker Server 9 in mind. Some of the settings will be in different places in older versions. Consult your server manual if you have an older version and get stuck. Setting up AutoUpdate If you want to use AutoUpdate, you need to set a few things up. It’s a bit of a pain, but it’s a one-time process, so dive on in and get it done, already.\nTurn on AutoUpdate in FileMaker Server First, you need to tell FileMaker Server you want to use AutoUpdate. Unfortunately, there’s a typo in the manual, so you may have trouble finding this one.\nLaunch the FileMaker Server Admin Console and log in to your server.\nTo find the console, point your web browser at port 16000 on your FileMaker Server. In other words, if your FileMaker Server computer’s IP address is 192.168.1.2, you would go to this URL in your browser: http://192.168.1.2:16000. The page that comes up has a link to open the Admin Console. In the console sidebar, click Database Server under Configuration.\nThis is where you configure the FileMaker database server itself, which includes AutoUpdate. If necessary, switch to the FileMaker Pro Clients tab.\nSince AutoUpdate sends plug-ins to connected clients, I suppose it makes sense that the setting is here. (If you read the FileMaker Server manual, it told you to look under Server Plug-ins instead, which is not correct.) Turn on Allow FileMaker Pro clients to download updates automatically.\nOnce you’ve made the change, be sure and click Save. You\u0026rsquo;ll find a lot of switches and dials in FileMaker Server Admin, but this right here is the one you want.\nNow you’ve told FileMaker Server you want to use the AutoUpdate feature.\nNote: All Six Fried Rice plug-ins ship ready for AutoUpdate. You can skip the next two sections. Instead, just look in your download archive for a folder called AutoUpdate Files. Copy the folder inside the AutoUpdate Files folder into the AutoUpdate folder on your FileMaker Server. (OK, I lied. Look under Installing Plug-in Files below to find out where the AutoUpdate folder is.) Preparing Plug-ins for AutoUpdate If you’re only using Microsoft Windows, you can skip this step. It only applies to Mac OS X plug-ins. On Mac OS X, a plug-in is actually a folder full of files. It just looks like a single file in the Finder. In order for FileMaker Server to handle it properly, you need to stuff that folder, and all its contents, into something called a tar file. Tar (which is unix-speak for a “tape archive”) is sort of like zip without compression: it takes a lot of files and folders and turns them into one single file.\nTo tar your plug-in, you need to use the OS X command line:\nPlace a copy of the Mac OS X version of the plug-in on your desktop.\nThis might not sound important, but it is. If the plug-in isn’t on your desktop, the next steps won’t work, and you’ll have to start over again. Launch Terminal.\nIt is in your Utilities folder. In the terminal window, type cd Desktop and then press return or enter.\nThis tells terminal you want to work on the Desktop. Again, in the terminal window, type tar cvf 'My Cool Plug-in.fmplugin.tar' then press the space bar.\nOnly, instead of “My Cool Plug-in”, type the exact name of the plug-in you’re using. Again, you have to be exact. You also have to put exactly .fmplugin.tar on the end of the name. Drag the plug-in file from the Desktop right into the terminal window and release the mouse.\nYou don’t have to have good aim; just drop it anywhere in the terminal window. This will tell the terminal to put the full path to the plug-in on the end of your command. Press enter or return.\nTar starts processing files. So you know it’s working, it lists out each file as it adds it to the archive. You’re done. You can quit Terminal if you want. If you look on your Desktop, you’ll now have a new file called My Cool Plug-in.fmplugin.tar. You’ll use this file in a moment.\nInstalling Plug-in Files In order for your clients to download the plug-ins, they need to be stored on the server. This part is a little tricky because you have to create just the right folders, with just the right names, and put them in just the right places.\nFirst, you need to find where AutoUpdate files go. They should be placed in a folder called AutoUpdate, which is usually in the same place as your .fp7 database files. On Windows:\nC:\\Program Files\\FileMaker\\FileMaker Server\\Data\\Databases\\AutoUpdate\\ And on Mac OS X:\n/Library/FileMaker Server/Data/Databases/AutoUpdate/ If the AutoUpdate folder isn’t there, you can create one yourself. Just make sure you call it AutoUpdate with no space.\nNote: If you keep your databases in an alternate folder (which can be set up in the Server Admin Console), you can put the AutoUpdate files there instead. Just create a folder yourself called AutoUpdate and put it at the root of your database folder. You’re also free to keep your AutoUpdate files in the standard place, even though your database are somewhere else. But you don’t just drop the plug-ins in these folders. Alas, that would be too easy to truly exercise your Sysadmin muscles. Instead, you have to create a specialized folder structure that helps FileMaker keep track of different plug-in versions.\nIn the AutoUpdate folder, create a folder with the same name as the plug-in. When you name the folder, ignore the file extension. In other words, if the plug-in is called 6Barcode.fmx, name the folder 6Barcode.\nWarning: Really, truly, the folder must have exactly the same name. Spaces count. Dashes count. Funny characters you don’t know how to type count. If necessary, copy the name from the plug-in file and paste it in as the folder name (removing the extension if necessary). In your new folder, add a folder named for the version number of the plug-in. For example, if you’re installing version 1.5 of the plug-in, make a folder called 1.5. This folder’s name isn’t quite as persnickety as its parent. If the plug-in is version 1.5.3.4627 x54e9 you can still call the folder 1.5. You can call it 3.0 if you want. Just make sure you know what you called it because when you script the plug-in installation later, you’ll ask for this version by name.\nPut the plug-in files inside the version folder you created in step 2. Now, finally, you’re ready to put the plug-ins themselves on the server. For the Windows plug-ins (with a .fmx file name extension) just drop the plug-in itself in the version folder. If you’re also installing a Mac OS X plug-in, put the tar archive of the plug-in in the version folder.\nNow, you server is ready to deploy the plug-in. But you’re not done yet. You still have to tell the clients to come and get it.\nWriting an AutoUpdate Script FileMaker doesn’t just download every plug-in as soon as it connects. Instead, you get to tell it which plug-in(s) and version you want in each database. You do this by writing a (relatively complicated) script that talks to FileMaker Server and pulls down the plug-in as needed.\nThis script uses something called the AutoUpdate Plug-in. Yeah, I know. Ironic. You need a plug-in to use the plug-in installation system. But don’t fret. The AutoUpdate Plug-in is included when you install FileMaker Pro or FileMaker Pro Advanced. So unless you (or someone else) has turned it off, it will be there. And the script is smart enough to check for it, and give a meaningful error if it isn’t installed.\nNote: Again, if you’re using a Six Fried Rice plug-in you don’t have to worry about this. Each of our plug-ins includes a Helper database that has all the scripting you need. Just put the Helper database on your FileMaker Server, and then run the script from within your own database using the Perform Script script step. If you’re not one of the lucky SFR plug-in users, read on. Scripting the AutoUpdate system is a three step process:\nCheck to see if the plug-in is already installed. If it isn’t, make sure it is available on the server. If it is, install it. Rather than force you through the drudgery of writing this script yourself, here is one you can borrow. In fact, keep it. We don’t mind.\n# Check to see if the plug-in is already installed If [ Not IsValid ( myplug_Version ) ] ## Check to see if the AutoUpdate Plug-in is installed If [ Not IsValid( FMSAUC_Version ( 0 ) )] Show Custom Dialog [ “Installation Error”; “The AutoUpdate plug-in is not available.” ] Else If [ Get ( MultiUserState ) \u0026lt;\u0026gt; 2 ] Show Custom Dialog [ “Installation Error”; “This database has to be on FileMaker Server for AutoUpdate to work.” ] Else # Check for the plug-in on the server Set Variable [ $versions; FMSAUC_FindPlugIn ( “My Cool Plug-in” ) ] If [ $versions = “-1” ] Show Custom Dialog [ “Installation Error”; “It looks like AutoUpdate isn’t enabled on the server.” ] Else If [ PatternCount($versions, “1.5”) = 0 ] Show Custom Dialog [ “Installation Error”; “The server doesn’t have the right version of the plug-in.” ] Else # Update the Plug-in Set Variable [ $plugin_result; FMSAUC_UpdatePlugIn ( “My Cool Plug-in 1.5” ) ] If [ $plugin_result \u0026lt;\u0026gt; 0 ] Show Custom Dialog [ “Installation Error”; “Something unexpected happened: ” \u0026amp; $plugin_result ] End If End If End If End If When you create this script in your database, keep these things in mind:\nInstead of myplug_Version put a call to your plugins version function. Instead of My Cool Plug-in, put the real, exact name of your plug-in. Instead of 1.5, specify a version number that matches the folder you created on your server. If you’re using FileMaker 7, or don’t have FileMaker Pro Advanced, use global fields instead of variables (the variables in this script start with $). Calling the Script Once the script is written, you need to decide when to call it. By far the easiest option is to run the script whenever your database opens. This will ensure the plug-in is installed and available for all your users.\nTo make the script run when your database is open, open your database, then choose File → File Options. The window that pops up has a place where you can pick one script to run when the file opens.\nTip: If you already have an opening script, just have it perform your AutoUpdate script when it’s done doing whatever it does. If you want, you can defer plug-in installation until it is really needed. For example, if you only use the plug-in in one special script, and that script is only run by a few of your users, then you can perform the AutoUpdate at the top of this special script instead. That way, the plug-in will only be installed the first time a user really needs it.\nPotential Problems If you’ve gotten this far, you’re probably all set. Whenever someone opens your database, they’ll get the plug-in(s) she needs automatically. The only impact will be a short delay the first time, as the plug-in is downloaded. It is smooth-as-silk.\nBut sometimes, you may encounter a problem or two.\nLicensing obstructions First of all, it probably goes without saying, but if you don’t own enough licenses of your plug-in, you can’t use AutoUpdate. Although it is automated, it still installs the plug-in on every client computer, and you still need to buy a license that allows this.\nFor example, if you buy a Six Fried Rice plug-in you should get the server license. It lets you install the plug-in on one server, and use AutoUpdate to install it on as many connecting client computers as you want. It’s licensed for the server and all clients. But even with enough licenses, Some plug-ins require convoluted licensing procedures because their creators are convinced you would steal the plug-in if you could. These copy protection schemes can sometimes get in the way of AutoUpdate. You may run into problems like these:\nThe plug-in installs properly, but it runs in a demo or trial mode, with splash screens or limited functionality. The plug-in complains that it is being used on too many machines at once. If this happens to you, contact your plug-in vendor and see what options they provide. Some offer alternate registration mechanisms (like scripted registration) so you can use AutoUpdate successfully. If they don’t, complain. AutoUpdate has been in FileMaker Server for nigh on 140 years now, and it is a huge timesaver for server administrators. You should be able to use it.\nPermissions Problems If you’re using a version of FileMaker Pro older than 9.0, you may run in to permissions problems. If your users aren’t allowed to add files to the Extensions folder in the FileMaker folder, then AutoUpdate can’t do its job. Again, our script will tell you this when it runs.\nIf this is the case in your organization, you only have a few options:\nUpgrade to FileMaker 9. This version works around the permissions problems by installing the plug-in on a per-user basis, instead of for all users at once.\nInstall the plug-in manually. This is often not a bad option. Most organizations that have locked-down desktops also have the tools necessary to deploy software across multiple computers. See if your sysadmin can use their tools to install the plug-in in everyone’s Extensions folder for you.\nGet the permissions changed. It is possible (although not common) to give restricted users permission to install only plug-ins, without opening up the entire computer. If you or your sysadmin can make this change to network security, AutoUpdate will begin to work.\nWhere’s My Plug-in? Since FileMaker 7+, plug-ins can be found in the Extension folder in your FileMaker directory. FileMaker 9 has thrown a teeny little wrinkle into this simplicity. Plug-ins can now be found in a secondary location under the user’s account folder. For example, if the username was jantunes the folders would be:\nFor Windows:\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\jantunes\\Local Settings\\Application Data\\FileMaker\\Extensions For Mac OS X:\n/Users/jantunes/Library/Application Support/FileMaker/Extensions This is actually a nice addition because now a user doesn’t need permissions to install software on their computer to take advantage of AutoUpdate. Next time you are looking for a plug-in that can’t be found in the standard Extension directory, be sure to check here. Also, if you are on windows, the Local Settings directory defaults to hidden so you may have to work a little harder to get there.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/sfr/automate-filemaker-plugin-deployment/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Automate FileMaker Plug-in Deployment"},{"content":"[ed: This was the most popular post on Six Fried Rice by far. The diagram I made was translated into French and Japanese by community members (with permission) and passed around for years.]\nFileMaker Server 9 represents a pretty significant redesign of the FileMaker Server product line. One consequence of all the changes is that things may not work properly without reconfiguring your firewall(s). Improper firewall configuration can lead to all kinds of problems, some obvious (I can’t connect to my server) and some not-so-obvious (the Server Admin Console opens, and then hangs). This article attempts to explain in full detail exactly how each participant in the FileMaker ecosystem communicates, so you can jump right past these problems and get to developing awesome databases.\nNote: Before we dive in, if you’re wondering what all this Firewall stuff does, exactly (what is a port number, after all?), there’s a quick introduction to firewalls at the end of this article. Click here to scroll down to it. Then, when you’re done, scroll back up here and carry on with the article. The Big Picture A picture’s worth a thousand words, so before we get into the details, here’s a birds-eye view of the FileMaker Server landscape:\nFileMaker\u0026rsquo;s network communication landscape has become quite complex. This diagram shows what talks to what, on what ports, and why.\nYou can also download a high-quality PDF version of the diagram:\nIn English In French (courtesy of Informatique Direct Impact inc.) In Japanese (courtesy of Splash Inc.) Note: Thanks to Eric Jacobson at FileMaker, Inc. for reviewing and correcting this diagram. This picture shows all the parts your FileMaker setup might include, along with the important lines of communication and critical port numbers. On the bright side, you probably don’t have all these pieces, and you almost certainly don’t have a firewall between each of the parts you do have.\nFiguring out What to Configure In order for things to work smoothly, you need to open the right ports in your firewall. The task is relatively deterministic:\nIdentify which of the components listed below are present on your network. Figure out which of your components are separated by a firewall. Look to see if any component on your list listens to a component on the other side of a firewall. (You can see who listens to whom below). Note which port numbers the listening component uses. Open the port numbers on your list in the firewall. Chances are good your firewall setup falls into one of two categories:\nYou have a firewall running on each computer. If this is the case, pay attention to which components are running on different computers. Any time a component on one computer listens to a component on another computer, you need to open up the right port on the first computer. You have one network firewall running between the server computer(s) and the client computer(s). In this case, you’re only concerned with components on the client side of things that talk to components on the server side. Configure your firewall so that server side components can listen to their clients on the ports listed below. Tip: When I worked at a real company, I never really had to worry about all this. I had a Drew who took care of all the network configuration. If you have a Drew (or Drucilla) too, just print out this article and give it to them. They’ll skip right to the details below and get things working in no time flat. The Gory Details Without further ado, here are all the relevant parts, complete with firewally port information.\nThe FileMaker Database Server This is the heart of your FileMaker setup. It’s the thing that actually serves your databases. On windows, it’s the FileMaker Server and FileMaker Server Helper services.

The Web Publishing Engine This component can be installed on the same machine as the database server, or the same machine as the web server, or on its own machine. It provides FileMaker’s web publishing capabilities, including Instant Web Publishing, and Custom Web Publishing with XML and XSLT. Also note that PHP code talks to the Web Publishing Engine through its XML interface.\nListens to…\n16000 and 16004 through 16018: The web server (Apache or IIS) sends web requests and receives responses The Web Server When you install FileMaker Server, it integrates with your web server (IIS on Windows, and Apache on Mac OS X). The web server continues to handle basic pages, images, etc… But when it receives requests for FileMaker content (like Instant Web Publishing pages) it forwards those requests on to the Web Publishing Engine.\nListens to…\n80: Normal web requests from a browser, and PHP API connections 443: Secure (HTTPS) web requests from a browser Warning: Unlike most of the components in a FileMaker setup, your web server can easily be configured to listen on any port or ports.

A Brief Introduction to Firewalls Before we get ahead of ourselves, it might help to explain what a firewall does, exactly. If your idea of a little light reading comes in a Cisco box, feel free to skip thid section.\nYou can have lots of programs on your server that provide network services. For example, in addition to FileMaker, your FileMaker server computer may have any (or all) of these:\nA file server, so you can copy files to and from its hard drive from your desktop. A remote control server so you can administer the computer from another machine. A web server, so you can publish web pages on the company intranet. An SSH server so you can log in to the computer’s command line. And dozens more… Whenever you connect to the server, it needs to know which of these services you’re trying to use. To facilitate this need, the network system has a concept called ports. Each service listens on a particular port. When you connect to the server, the program you’re connecting with knows which port to use, so it winds up talking to the right service on the other end. Ports are numbered, from zero to 65,535. So a server might listen on port 80, for instance, or port 24601.\nHow about an example? When you open your web browser and point it at, say, www.yahoo.com, it automatically connects to the Yahoo server on port 80. That’s because 80 is the standard web port. That same Yahoo server might run all kinds of other services, but only the web service hears people who talk on port 80.\nNote: Just because 80 is the standard port for normal web traffic doesn’t mean it’s the only one you can use. If you’ve ever seen a web address with a colon (:) in it, you’ve seen a web server using a non-standard port number. For example, the url http://ec2.sixfriedrice.com:3000/ tells your browser to connect to port number 3000 instead of the more typical port 80. Any program on a computer can listen on any port it wants (with a few irrelevant restrictions). But you don’t want something listening when it shouldn’t be (like a spyware program). In business, the concern is even greater. A simple software install on one computer could allow bad guys to access a computer in the office, and from there, the entire company network could be at risk. For these reasons, computers and networks use a firewall to restrict access to most network ports. The firewall sits at the front door to your computer like one of those bouncers at the uber-cool night clubs I’ve heard exist somewhere. When network traffic tries to find its way in to your computer, it is promptly turned away unless it’s on the list. Now, no matter how hard you try (or a piece of unruly software tries), you can’t get your computer to listen on a port that isn’t specifically allowed by the firewall.\nTrouble arises when you need server software (like FileMaker Server) to work. Not only do you have to wade through the 11 clicks it takes to get FileMaker installed. Now you have to tell your firewall system about it to. In particular, you have to allow a handful of important ports so the different parts can talk to one another through the firewall.\nThis is harder than it sounds because a FileMaker setup may have a lot of parts, and you have to know which parts talk to which other parts from where and on what ports to make sense of it all.\nIf you have your own port configuration tips, please leave us a comment below. And good luck configuring.\nBack to the top\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/sfr/configuring-firewall-ports-for-filemaker-9/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Configuring Firewall Ports for FileMaker 9"},{"content":"FileMaker’s find mode is a great feature. You can tell because, like all great technologies, it is easy to understand the first time you try it, and yet has a depth of capability that can be unlocked if you know a little more. Unfortunately, many FileMaker developers (and users) never venture beyond the simplest of finds. This series of articles aims to change that.\nThe Basics Everybody knows that to do a find, you first switch to find mode (View → Find Mode). Then you type in some stuff and click Find. When you’re in find mode, all your records (along with the field data in them) disappear, but the layout otherwise stays the same. It acts a lot like browse mode: you can type in edit fields, choose from pop-up menus, and click off checkboxes and radio buttons. You can copy and paste. You can even use the Edit → Find/Replace command, on the off chance you want to find something in your find criteria.\nWhen you fill out some fields and click Find, FileMaker goes to work, hunting down records that have data similar to the stuff you filled in. If you put “Bill” in the First Name field, FileMaker finds every customer whose name is Bill. If you know this much (and who doesn’t?) you may be able to live a long and happy FileMaker life and never know what you’re missing.\nBut for some of you, the time will come when you bump in to the limits of this simplistic view. Each of these presents a problem when that’s all you know about find mode:\nI have 632,788 customer records. I want to find Jo. not Joe. Not Joseph. Not Josephine. Just “Jo.” I need to find all the shirts that are available in red or blue. I’m looking for every order that came in on a Tuesday. Show me all the students that don’t live in town. But each of these is actually easy to get if you learn the secrets of find mode. The first secret we’re going to cover is Find Requests. These are the bread and butter of find mode, but they’re often misunderstood. Over the coming weeks, we’ll add more to this series. In all we’ll cover:\nFind requests (this one!) Find symbols Tricks with dates and times Finds of omission Find Requests As we mentioned above, find mode acts a lot like browse mode. This affinity goes deeper than most people realize. Did you know you can create new “records” in find mode? Of course they aren’t really records. After all, the very word record implies something is being recorded — put away for future reference. But the things you create in find mode are ephemeral: as soon as you switch back to browse mode, they’re gone.\nNote: Truthfully, the aren’t really gone just yet. You can choose Records → Modify Last Find to get them back. But the next time you perform a find, your previous set of find requests is lost permanently. In the vocabulary of FileMaker, the things you make in find mode are called requests. It makes sense really. You are requesting records. When in find mode, you can make as many requests as you want, and FileMaker will dutifully carry them all out, serving up the results when it is done. You make a new request in much the same way you make a new record:\nChoose Requests → New Request or Press Ctrl-n (on Windows) or Commandn (on Mac OS X) When FileMaker actually processes your find requests, it finds records that match any one of them. Consider these examples:\nIf you put “Bill” in the first name field, and “California” in the state field in the same request, FileMaker will only find customers named Bill who live in California.\nOn the other hand, if you create two requests (one with “Bill” and the other with “California”) you’ll probably get more records. FileMaker finds everyone named Bill (no matter what state they live in). It also finds everyone from California, no matter the name.\nIn nerdier terms, multiple requests create an or search: Records match either the first request or the second. Multiple criteria in one request makes an and search because records have to match the first field and the second.\nThis short (and silent) video illustrates how multiple find requests work:\nIf you put multiple criteria in one request, records must match all of them. If you put them in separate requests, records have to match any of them.\nTune in next time to learn more about the secret life of find mode.\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/sfr/the-secret-life-of-find-mode-requests/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"The Secret Life of Find Mode: Requests"},{"content":"In FileMaker 9 Tip #6 we explained how to use the new Append to PDF feature in FileMaker 9. With it, you can build up a PDF file over many steps in a script, to produce a much more complex and data-rich PDF than was ever possible before. One of our readers, Norman Foster, asked a very sensible question:\nThis Append looks great but can it paginate across the entire set of PDF files. I want the page numbers in footers or headers, and I want them to be sequential. Norman Foster The Append to PDF Feature doesn’t do this automatically, but with a little calculation magic, it can be done.\nThe predicament First, a little background. If you put the special symbol ## in a text object on the layout, FileMaker will automatically replace it with the current page number when the layout is printed. It is common practice to drop this special symbol in the header or footer of a printed report so you get nice page numbering. (In fact, FileMaker’s layout creation assistants often do this for you.)\nBut in a world where several Save as PDF jobs can produce one PDF, this little symbol loses some of its luster. Your previously perfect page numbering now looks something like this: 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Not exactly ideal.\nChanging the page number To solve this problem, you’ll need a little calculation acumen. If you’re a calculation whiz, this will be easy. And if you’re not, this will be informative. Calculations are an important part of the FileMaker utility belt.\nThe trick lies in the Get(PageNumber) function. This function, when evaluated, returns the current page number if you’re in preview mode, printing, or saving a PDF. But you already know the current page number. The problem is you want to give it a different number. So first, you need a way to tell FileMaker where you want the page numbering to start. You can then create a second field that calculates the appropriate page number by adding FileMaker’s notion of the current page number to your preferred starting point.\nCreate a new number field called \u0026ldquo;Page Start\u0026rdquo;. Then click Options and, in the Storage tab, turn on “Use global storage (one value for all records).”\nA global field is special because it doesn’t have a distinct value in each record. Instead, you set it once and it changes in every record at once (or you might say it is separate from the records, stored in one place for the whole table.) Since you want this starting page number to be noticed across the entire report, it needs to be in a global field. Create a new calculation field called \u0026ldquo;Page Number\u0026rdquo;\nWhen you click Create, FileMaker pops up the Specify Calculation dialog box. In the Specify Calculation dialog box, enter the following calculation\nPage Start + Get ( PageNumber ) – 1\nThis formula says this field should show the page number, plus whatever starting page you put in the global field. You subtract one because page numbers don’t start with zero. In other words, if you tell FileMaker to start on page 17, you want the first page to be 17, not 18.\nWhen you’re finished, Click OK a few times to close the open dialog boxes. You now have two new fields at your disposal: Page Start and Page Number.\nThe Page Number field will show the properly adjusted page number on any printed layout (it will just show a ? in browse mode because the Get(PageNumber) function isn’t valid in browse mode.) On your layout, replace the ## page number symbol with this new Page Number field.\nNote: You’ll need a Page Number field in each table that you’ll be printing from. Bummer. Fixing the script If you test your reports now, you’ll notice it doesn’t quite work yet. You’re not doing anything with the Page Start field, so the Page Number field has no chance of updating itself. In your script, where you assemble the multi-part PDF, you’ll have to set the Page Start field appropriately before each Save Records as PDF script step.\nBut how do you know what to set it to? If the first PDF had seven pages, for instance, you’d want to put 8 in the Page Start field before you append the second part to the PDF. So you need to figure out how many pages each part has. It’s easy to do, but not as obvious as one would hope. Here’s the snippet of script code that does the job:\nEnter Preview Mode Go to Record/Request/Page [Last] Set Field [Page Start, Page Start + Get ( PageNumber )] Enter Browse Mode This code finds the page count by switching to preview mode, jumping to the last page, and calling upon the now-familiar Get(PageNumber) function. You add the calculated page count to the Page Start field so the new starting page number is updated appropriately.\nNote: When you assemble your final script, don’t forget to set the Page Start field to 1 in the beginning. If you do forget, every time you run the script, you’ll push the page numbers higher and higher. Here’s a sample script that prints three parts:\n# Put the customer list in the report Go to Layout [Customer List] Set Field [Page Start, 1] Save Records as PDF […] # # Update the Page Start Enter Preview Mode Go to Record/Request/Page [Last] Set Field [Page Start, Page Start + Get ( PageNumber )] # # Now append a list of orders Enter Browse Mode Go to Layout [Order List] Save Records as PDF [Append, …] # # Update the Page Start Enter Preview Mode Go to Record/Request/Page [Last] Set Field [Page Start, Page Start + Get ( PageNumber )] # # And finally append a list of quotes Enter Browse Mode Go to Layout [Quote List] Save Records as PDF [Append, …] Tip: If you’re a savvy scripter, you may be bugged by all the repetition in that script (I certainly am). You are, of course, free to divide this script up as you see fit. For instance, it might be nice to write a more generic Update Page Start script that takes care of the preview-count-pages-update-start stuff. Total page count If you want, like Norman, to show the total page count on each page, you’ll have to do a little more work. Before you begin saving PDFs, you need to visit each layout and count the pages, keeping track of the total as you go. You’ll need one more global field, too, to hold the total page count. Add these lines to the top of the script to get it done:\nGo to Layout [Customer List] Enter Preview Mode Go to Record/Request/Page [Last] Set Field [Total Page Count, Get ( PageNumber )] Go to Layout [Order List] Go to Record/Request/Page [Last] Set Field [Total Page Count, Total Page Count + Get ( PageNumber )] Go to Layout [Quote List] Go to Record/Request/Page [Last] Set Field [Total Page Count, Total Page Count + Get ( PageNumber )] Enter Browse Mode Using the techniques outlined here, you can keep your handy page numbers, and still use the seriously cool append to PDF feature.\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/sfr/custom-page-numbers-in-pdfs-and-printed-reports/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Custom Page Numbers in PDFs and Printed Reports"},{"content":"This question came up on Macintouch:\nCan you import an ASCII (.txt) file into Filemaker Pro 9 that uses a dollar sign ($) as a field delimiter within a record? The file is too big to bring into Excel first (on the way to filemaker). Macintouch Reader [ed: Alas the Macintouch link seems to be dead and it appears the site was blocking archive.org. I\u0026rsquo;ve left the original link in place. (Aside: This is a good time to mention that I miss Roc Ford.)]\nUnfortunately, FileMaker 9 does not change the supported import formats, and $ delimited is not on the list. On the bright side, there are several ways to deal with this sort of thing in FileMaker.\nImport and Parse You can go ahead and import the file. FileMaker will probably see each line in the file as one field value. Create a temporary text field in your table, then import the file, mapping its one line to the new field. Using a looping script, go through each record, parse the incoming text, and move it to your real fields:\nGo to Record/Request/Page [First] Loop Set Field [My Field, GetValue(Substitute(TEMP, “$”, “¶”), 3)] # add as many Set Field steps as you need Go to Record/Request/Page [Next, Exit after Last] End Loop In the above code snippet, we use this calculation to parse the incoming text:\nGetValue(Substitute(TEMP, “$”, “¶”), 3) It grabs the third value from the $-delimited file. Here’s how it works:\nFirst, it turns every $ into a newline. So instead of this:\nSophia$Coffey$12/29/2001 You now have this:\nSophia Coffey 12/29/2001 Then, we call upon the GetValue function to pull one line out of this multi-line bit of text.\nPre-clean the Data If you prefer, you can clean the file up before import. Many text editors have powerful search and replace functions, and can handle files that bring Excel to its knees.\nOn Mac OS X, if you’re moderately comfortable on the command line, you can do this:\ntr $ ‘\\t’ \u0026lt; yourfile.txt \u0026gt; thecleanfile.txt This command will [tr]anslate every $ into a tab, and put the new cleaned-up data in a file called thecleanfile.txt. You can then import the file as a tab-delimited file.\nWarning: If the original file contains tabs, they will get in the way, so you need to convert them to something else (like spaces) first. Using these techniques, you can bring many atypical data formats into FileMaker, where they’re much easier to work with.\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/sfr/importing-non-standard-text-files/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Importing Non-Standard Text Files"},{"content":"One of the most exciting new features in FileMaker 9 is Conditional Formatting. I think this is awesome because now you can apply dynamic custom styles to layout elements without adding dozens of crufty unstored calcs to your table. When I first started playing with conditional formatting, though, I felt a little let down by one thing: There’s apparently no way to make something disappear using conditional formatting. I often have the need to show something to my user — an informational message, indicator icon, or even a button — only under certain conditions. It turns out that with some creative thinking, you can show and hide layout elements with conditional formatting. (Some restrictions apply.)\nThis is actually two techniques in one. The solution is simple if you’re only trying to hide some text. If you have a graphic, button, or collection of objects to hide, on the other hand, you’ll use a different method.\nMaking Text Disappear To make some text disappear — an informational label by a field, or a warning message that doesn’t apply, for example — simply change the text color to match the background color. For example, suppose you have a database that looks like this:\nThis database clearly labels eash reauired filed in an attention-seeking way.\nYou want the little “[required]” label next to a field to disappear when your user enters something in the field. This is a breeze:\nSelect the text label and choose Format → Conditional.\nThe Conditional Formatting for selected objects dialog box appears. Click Add.\nFileMaker adds a new line to the Condition list. In other words, you’re establishing a condition under which you want special formatting applied to this object. Click Specify and enter not IsEmpty(Customers::First Name) in the Specify Calculation window.\nIn this case, you want to format the label when the First Name field is not empty. When the formula you entered evaluates to a true value, the formatting will be applied. Click OK to close the Specify Calculation dialog box.\nNow you need to tell FileMaker what kind of formatting to apply. Turn on the Text Color check box and pick an appropriate color from the rainbow-colored pop-up menu beside it.\nChoose a color that matches your background color exactly. In the picture above, the background is FileMaker’s lighest gray color, so I picked that color here. When you’re finished with these steps, click OK in the Conditional Formatting window and switch to Browse mode. Now as you enter information in the fields on the layout, the “[required]” reminders will disappear like magic:\nThe red labels have disappeared for the fields that are no longer empty.\nNote: You could also make the text invisible on the layout, then use conditional formatting to make the object appear (by applying a visible color) when you want it to show. This might make the condition formula a little more obvious because it is expressed positively instead of negatively. But having invisible items on the layout is a nuisance. If you find it easier to write a formula saying when the text should appear, do that. Then put not in front of it. It’s that easy. Making Other Things Disappear The technique above has a pretty serious limitation: it only works with a single text object. If you’re dealing with a graphic (perhaps it is an icon that marks each unpaid invoice) or some other object, you’re not going to make it disappear by turning it white. In fact, if you select most kinds of layout objects, the Format → Conditional menu command dims: FileMaker can only apply conditional formatting to text objects, fields, buttons, and web viewers.\nTo work around this limitation, you have to get a little creative: Use an empty text object:\nUsing the Text tool in Layout mode, create a new text object (by clicking somewhere on the layout) and type a single space. Then click outside it so it’s no longer expecting input.\nYou now have a (mostly) empty text object that you can resize and position as you see fit. (You need the space because FileMaker will automatically delete the text object if you make it completely empty.) Position this text object over the element or elements you want to hide.\nYou may need to resize it so it covers the item completely. Also, make sure it is in front of the item it is hiding (use Arrange → Bring to Front if necessary). Choose Format → Conditional and apply conditional formatting just like you did in the previous example.\nThis time, though, turn on the Fill Color check box instead of Text Color. You should still choose a color that matches the background. When you’re finished, switch to Browse mode and give it a try. When your formatting condition is met, everything under the text object will disappear.\nDealing with Buttons The first gotcha with this technique is that although you hide an item from view, you don’t hide it from the mouse. If the thing you’re covering up is a button, it will still be clickable even when hidden. Luckily, this is easy to fix: Just modify the button’s script so it does nothing when the button is hidden. Add a snippet of code like this to the top of your script:\nIf [ IsEmpty(Customer::Email Address) ] Exit Script End If The formula in the If step should match the one you used in the Conditional Formatting dialog box exactly. Now, although the button is clickable, it won’t do anything. And since you can’t see it, you won’t be inclined to click it anyway. Problem solved.\nOther Limitations Buttons aren’t the only layout objects that present a challenge. Fields can also be entered even when hidden. In fact, fields are even worse: You can tab into them without clicking at all. They show dotted field frame outlines when you click in a blank spot on the layout. And they sometimes show their information right over the top of your carefully placed coverup. In general, this technique is not suitable for hiding fields. Same goes for Tab controls and Web Viewers.\nFinally, sometimes the color behind the thing you’re trying to hide is not consistent. The most typical example is a portal with alternating background colors. In a case like this, there’s no straight forward way to decide what color the empty text object should take on when it comes time to hide.\nThese limitations aside, this technique provides a simple way to add more dynamic behavior to your user interfaces without complicating the underlying data model. That’s almost always a win in my book.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/sfr/filemaker-9-tip-1-hiding-something-on-the-layout/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"FileMaker 9 Tip #1: Hiding Something on the Layout"},{"content":"In the old days, we used to joke that FileMaker’s user interface tools were stuck in the 1970s. You could make a long list of things every application in the world did that were hard to do in your own FileMaker-based systems. In the last several years, though, FileMaker Inc. has knocked a lot of biggies off this list: Custom Menus, Tab Controls, modern-looking check boxes and radio buttons. Oh wait, scratch that last one.\nNow we’re left to fuss about things that are a lot less significant. But one area of constant annoyance in my user interface work is disabled buttons. I got my first Mac in 1986, and way back then, if some button on the screen just didn’t apply, it was sensibly grayed out, giving the user a clear indication that it wasn’t worth clicking. But in FileMaker, if you put a button on a layout, it has just one look. Even if you-the-wise-developer know exactly when it shouldn’t be clicked, you have no simple way to tell your user. Or do you?\nSometimes, when it was important enough, you may have added a calculation field to the table that you could layer over the top of the button to simulate grayed out text. But anyone whose read much on this blog knows I’m loathe to add anything but real data to my tables. So this method, while possible, is far from perfect.\nToday, though, with the release of FileMaker 9, you now have a fantastic option for disabling buttons: use Conditional Formatting. Most of the conditional formatting examples you’ve seen have focused on fields and field labels. But FileMaker dutifully lets you assign conditional formatting to a standard button as well.\nJust select the button and choose Format → Conditional. You can tell FileMaker to turn the button’s label and/or fill color to a lighter shade of whatever under any condition you can dream up (you use a calculation formula to decide when each custom format applies).\nHere’s a closeup of one of my databases before and after this technique is applied:\nTwo buttons. Nothing really wrong with this at first glance. But what if the email address is empty?\nThis version makes it clear to the user that the Send Email function isn\u0026rsquo;t available right now.\nCan you guess which one comes from a record with no email address? Thought so.\nEditors Note I’m sure Geoff meant to add this but it must have slipped his mind…. This method for disabling buttons just makes the button appear to be disabled. Don’t confuse this for actually disabling the button completely. To kill the button completely, I would suggest using a custom function in your conditional formating. It should return true when the button should be clickable. Then you can just put that same custom function in an If block around your script too like so:\nIf [ my custom function ] // all my scripting stuff End If Now you have yourself a completely disabled button! The last nice addition would be to get that darn arrow to disappear…. but alas… the FileMaker 9 gods have chosen to keep that ability away from us mere mortals.\n– Jesse\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/sfr/filemaker-9-tip-2-disabling-a-button/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"FileMaker 9 Tip #2: Disabling a Button"},{"content":"FileMaker Pro 9 has another awesome new feature: Autoresize. Now your layout elements can stretch their legs when you give them a bigger window. Auto-resize lets you tell FileMaker how different elements on the layout should stretch and move as the window is resized by the user. But it can be a little tough to understand exactly how it works. Here are three tips to help you take best advantage of this awesome new feature.\nFirst, the Basics Before we dive into the tips, though, you might need a little intro on just how autoresize works. In FileMaker 9, every object on the layout has a set of anchors that can link it to the edge of the window. You turn these anchors on and off in the Object Info palette (View → Object Info). You can see the anchor settings in FileMaker 9’s new-and-improved Object Info palette right here:\nThe new Object Info palette has checkboxes to control Autoresize\nYou turn an anchor’s check box on if you want FileMaker to hook that side of the object to the side of the window.\nChances are, if you look at any of your layout objects right now, they’ll all be anchored on the top and left. This is the way objects start out life, and it makes them work just like they did in older versions of FileMaker: no matter how big you make the window, the object stays in the same spot, as though it’s anchored to the top and left edges of the window.\nIf you turn on the bottom and right anchors instead, the object will move as you resize the window. It will stay the same distance from the bottom and right edges of the window, so when the window gets bigger, the object effectively moves down and right.\nEven better, if you anchor an object on both the right and left it will actually get bigger with the window. Just picture those anchors holding tight to the sides of the window, stretching the object as they go. Of course you can anchor an object on the top and bottom to make it stretch taller. You can even turn on all four anchors to make it grow or shrink every which way.\nResize Early, Resize Often Our first autoresize tip is more advice than technique: Use autoresize practically everywhere. Even if your users are all in the same office, with the same size screens and nothing better to do on their computers than use your database, it is still worth doing. Once you get the hang of it, it only takes a few seconds to auto-resize-enhance a typical layout. And once you do, you’ve made life easier for your users.\nAnd as you start adding new layouts, think about autoresize from the very beginning. Set anchors as you go, and test windows at multiple sizes.\nOf course there are some situations where autoresize is not appropriate. For instance, layouts that are primarily destined for the printer usually have a very specific size and arrangement so things properly fit paper. Autoresize doesn’t make sense for layouts like this. You also don’t need to bother with autoresize on layouts that operate behind the scenes, where scripts get their work done.\nTip: See Nick’s comment below about using Autoresize on printed reports to handle different paper sizes or orientations. I haven’t tried this yet but it sounds like a fantastic idea. Set the Width When an object is anchored on any particular side, FileMaker keeps the distance between the object and that side of the layout constant. As the layout’s edge moves, so does the object.\nThis begs the question: where’s the right edge of a layout? After all, the other three sides are easy:\n– The top and left are just the edges of the database window itself. – You set the bottom yourself by dragging the bottom-most part boundary.\nBut the right edge is a real mystery. It turns out FileMaker decides on the right edge all by itself. It is an imaginary line set on the right edge of the right-most object on the layout.\nWhen you introduce autoresize, this can be a problem. If an object is anchored on the right, and it happens to be the right-most thing on the layout, it has a nasty habit of sliding so far right that it bumps right into the side of the window. Usually, you want a little space between each object and the window border.\nIf you’re lucky, you have a graphical element on the layout can can establish a better right edge. For instance, you might have a decorative line that stretches all the way across the layout. If you anchor this to the left and right, it will always stretch across the window. And since everything else on the layout is a little less to-the-right than the end of that line, they won’t have a problem keeping away from the edge of the window.\nIf you aren’t lucky, you’ll have to set the right edge yourself using a bit of a hack. Just put an invisible line on the layout where you want the right edge to be. (Set its line thickness to None to make it invisible.) This is a lousy solution, but it is the only one that works sometimes.\nThink Small When you do design with autoresize in mind, keep this in mind too: small is good. Within reason, you should generally design your layouts as small as possible. The reason is simple: FileMaker will never resize an element smaller than it is in Layout mode. If your layout is designed large, your users won’t be able to make the window smaller and still see the whole layout.\nThis takes getting used to. You’re accustomed to designing layouts at an ideal size, where each field is big enough to show typical data. As you work on a small layout in layout mode, you might begin to feel like all those tiny fields are ridiculous. “Nobody would ever want to work in my database at this size!” But keep this in mind: they won’t have to. When you design in layout mode, you’re no longer specifying the ideal size. Instead, you’re establishing the smallest size. It is reasonable that a layout at its smallest will be a little cramped. Once you switch to browse mode, everything will instantly adapt to a roomier window.\nHere’s a layout that’s probably a little too small for regular use:\nThe note field here is definitely too small to be user-friendly. But it\u0026rsquo;s big enough to see some notes in a pinch.\nBut most users will go ahead and make the window bigger. (in fact, you can do it for them: FileMaker remembers the size of the window when you close and re-open it. And you can always use scripts to set the window size if you’re needs are more esoteric.) Here’s a more normal presentation:\nMake the window a little bigger and suddenly all the fields are nicely proportioned.\nAt the same time, when a user wants things a little smaller for a moment (maybe they\u0026rsquo;re comparing something in FileMaker with the contents of a web page), they’ll be able to momentarily shrink it down so it’s easier to work with.\nFind your Center Have you ever built a pseudo-dialog-box in FileMaker? You know the kind: a layout that takes over the database window and forces the user to make some choices before they get back to your normal layouts. A lot of people like to make these things visually distinct by putting them inside a box, something like this:\nThis layout is drawn to look like a modal dialog box, forcing the user to make a choice before continuing.\nNow be honest with yourself. Every time you’ve done this, you’ve wished you could put the thing in the middle of the window. Unfortunately, since you don’t know how big the window will be, you can’t.\nIt isn’t entirely obvious at first, but with autoresize in FileMaker 9, you can. If you turn off all the anchors, FileMaker splits the difference as a window resizes. If it gets 100 pixels wider, the object moves 50 pixels, so that half the new space is on one side, and half is on the other.\nSo an object that is centered on the layout in layout mode, and has no anchors, will be centered on any size window. I’ll prove it:\nThe user has resized the window (so it is larger) and the dialog box is still in the middle.\nTwo Ways to Resize Portals Finally, you may have a portal that grows vertically thanks to autoresize. When you do, you’ll probably wonder which of these will happen:\nAs the window gets bigger, the portal does too, and it can show more rows. As the window gets bigger, each portal row does too. The number of rows stays the same. In fact, a perfectly reasonable developer might want either one. Sometimes a bigger window means you want to show more information about each item in the portal: bigger thumbnail images, larger notes fields, and so forth.\nBut it is probably more likely that you want more rows. After all, most portals just show tables of simple data, where extra height isn’t helpful. And seeing more related records is always nice.\nIt turns out FileMaker 9 can facilitate both needs. Here’s the scoop:\nIf the portal is anchored to the top and bottom, but everything on the portal is just anchored to the top, then the portal will get new rows as it grows. If, on the other hand, a growing portal contains any item (it only takes one) that is anchored on the bottom, then the portal rows themselves will grow so the downward-moving item doesn’t leave its row. Note: The item can be anchored on the top and the bottom if you want. You just need at least one item that is at least bottom anchored to get growing rows. Now you know more than you ever wanted to about FileMaker Pro 9’s autoresize feature. Let us know if you discover any cool tricks of your own.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/sfr/filemaker-9-tip-3-get-the-most-from-auto-resize/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"FileMaker 9 Tip #3: Get the Most from Autoresize"},{"content":"There comes a time in every FileMaker developer’s life when they need to export a file temporarily. Maybe you’re exporting records only to import them right back in again later. Or perhaps your creating a PDF file that you only want to email to someone.\nAnd with this need comes an eternal question: Where should you put it?\nFinally, in FileMaker 9, we have an answer.\nIn fact, every modern operating system provides a perfect place for this sort of thing: The so-called “temp folder.” This special folder has a few powers that make it an ideal candidate:\nIt is always there, so you never have to worry that your user might not have one. A user on the computer can always write to his temp folder. There’s no need to stress about permissions problems. Also, the temp folder can’t be seen by any other user, so it’s secure. Best of all, files in the temp folder are automatically deleted whenever the computer restarts. The temp folder is nothing new. It’s been right there on your Windows or Mac OS X computer from the very beginning. But it isn’t always in the same place, and it can be tough to find inside a FileMaker script.\nFileMaker 9 works around this problem with a new calculation function: Get(TemporaryPath). This function figures out where the best temp folder is on the computer FileMaker’s running on and returns its path, ready to use in a variable-based export.\nHere’s an example. Normally, you can’t “open” a file stored in a container field. FileMaker only lets you open the file directly if you’ve stored a reference to the file in the container. Here’s a script that works around this limitation. It exports the file to the temp folder, then imports a reference to it into a global. Finally, it tells FileMaker to open the temporary file.\nSet Variable [ $path; Get(TemporaryPath) \u0026amp; “my_temporary_file.jpg” ] Export Field Content [ My Container Field; $path ] Insert File [ Reference; My Global Container, $path ] Go to Field [ Select/perform; My Global Container ] ","img":false,"link":"/archive/sfr/filemaker-9-tip-4-temporary-files/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"FileMaker 9 Tip #4: Temporary Files"},{"content":"How many times have you wanted to produce a report that showed two different lists of records? Or a couple pages of summary information, then a list of raw data? Or a title page, then a few pages of charts, then one list of data, then a few more charts, then a second list? In FileMaker, reports are tied to layouts, and a layout is tied to just one table. Of course you can just print several reports one after the other, but that doesn’t help if you want to email the report as a PDF, or store it on the file server.\nLuckily, you can do all this (and more) with the new Append to PDF feature in FileMaker 9. Once you see it in action, you’ll agree it is very useful.\nNote: An expanded version of this tip will appear in the next issue of Advisor Basics of FileMaker Pro, a great magazine for folks learning FileMaker. The Advisor Basics version goes in to more detail, and covers page numbering and security considerations. You can subscribe here. [ed: FileMaker Advisor has ceased publishing since this was posted so this link is no longer valid.] Here’s the deal: You operate a web retailer. As business grows, it becomes more and more important to get the right data in the hands of your employees, so they can make good decisions. You decide you want everybody to have a special report in their in box every monday morning. This report should show the week’s totals on the first page, then summary information about how many new customers ordered from you, broken down by region, a list of aggregate sales information for top selling products, and a list of every order that was returned.\nBefore FileMaker 9, this would have been a very difficult report to produce. Each individual part isn’t too hard to do: some web viewers, a sub-summary report or two, and a list report. But putting all these divergent parts together in on report is essentially impossible (at least without heroic hacks and a handful of headaches).\nBut with FileMaker Pro 9’s new Append to PDF feature, this is an absolute breeze. Here’s how.\nBuild the Individual Parts First, build a separate layout for each individual part. In this example, you might have one layout with web viewers displaying each chart. Another layout, based on the Customers table, would have a sub-summary parts for City and State. The aggregate product sales data would come from the Order Line Item table, again with sub-summary parts. Finally, you would build a layout showing a list of orders.\nScript the PDF Once the layouts are in place, you can write a script that produces the final report. It might start off like this:\nGo to Layout [Weekly Summary] Set Field [Week Start, Get(CurrentDate)] Save Records as PDF [Restore; No Dialog; “Weekly Report.pdf”] This is old school FileMaker 8.5 stuff here. You’re just saving the record (ie: layout) as a PDF file called Weekly Report.pdf.\nNext, you want to export the new customer information. You add these steps to the script:\nGo to Layout [New Customer Info] **# find the new customers for this week** Enter Find Mode [] Set Field [Created, “GetAsText(Get(CurrentDate) – 7) \u0026amp; … \u0026amp; GetAsText(Get(CurrentDate) – 1)”] Perform Find [] **# and sort them for the sub-summaries Sort [Restore; No Dialog] At this point in the script, you’re ready to output the next section of the report. Just add the Save Records as PDF script step to your script, like you did before. If you look closely at the bottom of the Edit Script window, though, you’ll notice a new option. You can see it here:\nFileMaker 9 has added an \u0026ldquo;Append to existing PDF\u0026rdquo; option.\nTo get this technique to work, you need to do two things:\nTurn on the new “Append to existing PDF” check box Click Specify next to “Specify an output file” and specify a PDF file that already exists. If you do both these things, instead of replacing the PDF file when this step runs, FileMaker will add pages to the end of the PDF that is already there.\nTo complete the technique, add more steps to the script to visit additional layouts, perform the requisite finds and sorts, and append to the PDF.\nEmailing the Result When you use this technique to build up a PDF, you perform the Save Records as PDF script step several times. If you turn on FileMaker’s “Create email with file as attachment” option (in the Specify Output File dialog box) every time, you’ll end up with several emails. Instead, just turn this option on in the last Save Records as PDF. Each step will add more to the PDF on your hard drive, but only the last one will email it to the users. Since the PDF was appended, the email will include the results of the entire script.\nUsing this technique, and FileMaker 9’s new Append to PDF feature, you can build electronic reports that are much more complex than was ever before possible.

ESS is great and all, but you may be wondering how 9 helps regular FileMaker folk like us. In point of fact, 9 is chock full of fantastic new features that even the most humble database can benefit from right away. Chief among them is Conditional Formatting.\nWith this new capability, your database layouts can literally come alive. Fields can change color when they contain important information. Labels can go bold if the field needs updating. With a little creativity, things can even disappear when they no longer apply. And this isn\u0026rsquo;t just so much eye candy: You can easily build layouts that convey information beyond the raw data. You can guide the user in the right direction, call attention to important discrepancies, and give subtle cues about what will and won\u0026rsquo;t work. (Even if you’re a calculation pro and you think conditional formatting is old news, check out the sidebar “Everything New is Old Again” to get an idea of why conditional formatting is so cool.)\nEverything New is Old Again If you\u0026rsquo;re a more advanced FileMaker developer, you may have scoffed at that \u0026ldquo;conditional formatting\u0026rdquo; bullet point in the New Features list. After all, the reasoning goes, you could do all this stuff before with clever calculations. But don\u0026rsquo;t turn your back on conditional formatting just yet. It\u0026rsquo;s got a lot going for it:\nWhile it\u0026rsquo;s true that calculation fields can do some of what conditional formatting does, they can\u0026rsquo;t do everything. One example is fill color. There\u0026rsquo;s no way to make a calc field white text on a red background when the project\u0026rsquo;s due date passes, for example. With conditional formatting, this can be accomplished with just a few clicks.\nSpeaking of clicks, conditional formatting is point-and-click easy. FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s text formatting functions, on the other hand, are\u0026hellip;shall we say\u0026hellip;not. They require fiddling with complex calculations, making mysterious piles on your layout, and hand-coding RGB values, whatever that means. When a power feature like this suddenly becomes easier, it means more people will use it. Less nerdy developers will be more productive, and FileMaker databases all over the world will become more usable. That makes FileMaker more popular, which is good for all of us. It\u0026rsquo;s a circle-of-life kind of thing.\nMost importantly, conditional formatting puts these user interface tasks right where they belong: on the layout. Calculation fields are in your tables. And tables are supposed to be for data. FileMaker has been on a long march towards better data/interface separation (which is a good thing) for several years now, and this is another great step forward. No longer do you have to clutter up your table with a handful of \u0026ldquo;display only\u0026rdquo; fields that are hard to change later and just get in the way when you\u0026rsquo;re trying to do real table work.\nIn short, conditional formatting may not bring new power in absolute terms, but it makes old powers better, easier, and less invasive. The way I see it, that\u0026rsquo;s three times better than the old way.\nThe Mechanics Using conditional formatting is easy. Just remember that it applies to layout objects — the things you put on a layout. In particular, you can use conditional formatting with:\nText objects (like field labels, and bits of informational text on the layout) Fields on the layout Text-based buttons Web viewers Imagine you run a computer support hotline. Your FileMaker database keeps track of each of your customers, including their contact information, current balance, and payment information. (You can see just such a database in Figure 1).\nFigure 1This simple database keeps track of your customers. It\u0026rsquo;s not bad either: clean, simple, and easy to use. But with conditional formatting, it can be even better.\nRight away, you think of a way to put conditional formatting to use. When a customer\u0026rsquo;s balance is exhausted, they need to pony up before they get more support. That\u0026rsquo;s why the Balance field is prominently displayed on the layout. Nevertheless, when the phone\u0026rsquo;s ringing off the hook, you can easily forget to check it. It would be better if, as soon as you navigate to a drained customer\u0026rsquo;s record, FileMaker could call attention to the problem.\nIn layout mode, select the Balance field. Then choose Format → Conditional.\nThe Conditional Formatting dialog box pops up. You can see it in Figure 2. Click Add (it\u0026rsquo;s right below the empty white box at the top of the window).\nFileMaker adds a new condition to the top list, and makes the various pop-up menus, fields, and checkboxes in the bottom half of the window available. You\u0026rsquo;re about to define the condition under which you want certain field formatting to apply.\nThe first pop-up menu under Condition says \u0026ldquo;Value is,\u0026rdquo; which is just what you want.\nFrom the second pop-up menu, choose \u0026ldquo;less than or equal to\u0026rdquo;.\nNotice that the row of menus and boxes under Condition is starting to form a little statement: \u0026ldquo;Value is less than or equal to\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; In the entry box to the right of the \u0026ldquo;less than or equal to\u0026rdquo; pop-up menu, enter \u0026ldquo;0\u0026rdquo; (zero).\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve told FileMaker your special formatting will kick in when the value in the field gets down to zero — in other words, when the customer\u0026rsquo;s run out of balance. Now you\u0026rsquo;ll tell it how to format the field when this condition is met. Turn on the Fill Color checkbox and pick a dark red color from the color picker to the right of it. Then turn on the Text Color checkbox and pick white from its associated pop-up menu.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;re done, the Conditional Formatting window looks like Figure 2. Figure 2You visit the Conditional Formatting dialog box (Format → Conditional in layout mode) to set things up. At the top, you see a list of conditions (you can have more than one). Select one from the list, and FileMaker shows you its settings in the bottom half of the window.\nIf you click OK and then switch back to Browse mode, you can see your conditional formatting in action. The customer named Jesse Antunes has a zero balance, as you can see in Figure 3.\nFigure 3With conditional formatting in play, the balance field really pops when it wants your attention. (It would pop more if this were a color picture — try to imagine that\u0026rsquo;s bright red up there.)\nMultiple Conditions You probably noticed that the Conditional Formatting window is topped by a list of conditions. Clearly, you can have more than one. After all, you may need to communicate more than one message to your users. For example, why wait until the balance is totally gone before taking action? It would be better if the balance field turned an equally noticeable but less red-alert shade (like yellow) when the balance starts to reach the danger zone. This is (almost) a snap.\nJust follow the same steps you took to add the red color above. Make sure you click Add again to add a second condition. This time, though, choose \u0026ldquo;less than\u0026rdquo; from the second pop-up menu, and put \u0026ldquo;25\u0026rdquo; in the box. In other words, you want this formatting to take effect when the balance is under $25. Instead of red, pick a shade of yellow, and don\u0026rsquo;t turn on the \u0026ldquo;Text color\u0026rdquo; checkbox this time.\nIf you stop right there and test your layout in browse mode, you may be surprised to discover that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work quite as you intended. Customers with a low balance get a yellow background as expected. But now, customers with a zero balance do too. Remember you told FileMaker to turn the background yellow when the balance is less than 25. Dash it all: Zero is less than 25. When more than one condition matches, FileMaker tries to apply the formatting for all of them. But in this case, both conditions specify a background color. So the one that comes last in the condition list \u0026ldquo;wins.\u0026rdquo;\nThere are lots of ways to fix this problem. The most straight forward is this: Select the \u0026ldquo;less than 25\u0026rdquo; condition and change it to \u0026ldquo;between .01 and 24.99\u0026rdquo;. (When you choose the \u0026ldquo;between\u0026rdquo; option, FileMaker gives you two boxes to fill in.) Since this new condition doesn\u0026rsquo;t match the zero scenario, things work as expected.\nNote: If you\u0026rsquo;re the logically minded type, you may realize that you could just as easily have moved the \u0026ldquo;less than 25\u0026rdquo; condition above the \u0026ldquo;less than or equal to 0\u0026rdquo; condition in the list. Since FileMaker applies the formatting in order, if the zero condition comes last, it would win instead. Either method will work. Formatting Text Objects Now that you\u0026rsquo;ve got the swing of things, you decide to put a little more condition in your formats. Another problem you have is users who forget to fill in the required fields. True, you use field validation to remind them, but when someone\u0026rsquo;s in the middle of a call, it would be much better to clue them in to what still needs attention without a disruptive eleventh hour message box. How about you make the required field labels bold? That\u0026rsquo;s easy to do: just select each one and choose Format → Style → Bold.\nBut with conditional formatting, you can do one better: Make them bold only when the field is required and it hasn\u0026rsquo;t been filled in yet. As your user tabs through the record filling things in, the bold labels will fade away, but if they skip a required field it will be obvious since it\u0026rsquo;s the only one still bold.\nApplying conditional formatting to a text object (that\u0026rsquo;s what a field label is) is a little tougher. You\u0026rsquo;re interested in the value in the field, not the label, so you can\u0026rsquo;t just add a condition that starts with \u0026ldquo;value is\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; And FileMaker won\u0026rsquo;t let you if you try. When you choose Format → Conditional with a text object selected, the first pop-up menu for the condition has only one choice: \u0026ldquo;Formula is.\u0026rdquo;\nThis time, FileMaker wants you to write a formula (AKA \u0026ldquo;calculation\u0026rdquo;) to describe when the formatting should be applied. If you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with validation or record access calculations, this will feel familiar. Your goal is to write a calculation that expresses \u0026ldquo;truth\u0026rdquo; when the formats should apply. For example, the formula Customer::Balance \u0026lt; 25 is true when the balance is less than 25. This sort of formula is sometimes called a \u0026ldquo;boolean\u0026rdquo; formula because its result is either true or false: the two boolean values.\nNote: Formula-based conditions are not limited to text objects. You can pick \u0026ldquo;Formula is\u0026rdquo; from the pop-up menu no matter what type of object you\u0026rsquo;re formatting. Sometimes you need a formula to express a condition that is more complex than the built-in options can handle. In this case, your formula should be IsEmpty ( Customers::First Name ). The IsEmpty function returns true when the value you send it is empty, which is just exactly when you want your bold formatting to apply.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve specified your condition formula, turn on the Bold checkbox and click OK. Since you\u0026rsquo;re making text switch to bold, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to make the text object a little bigger than it already is. Bold text is wider, and if the object isn\u0026rsquo;t wide enough, the text will get cut off when the formatting is exercised.\nYou need to repeat these steps for each of the required fields. In Figure 4 you can see how it looks when first name, last name, and phone number have been formatted this way.\nFigure 4Top: The layout now has boldface field labels for each required field. Bottom: When you enter text in a field, the boldness goes away as soon as you tab to the next one. In this picture, you can easily see you missed a field.\nNote: You may be tempted to make the fields bold on the layout, then use conditional formatting to change them back to normal once data is filled in. (You would use the formula not IsEmpty ( Customers::First Name ) in this case). But this doesn\u0026rsquo;t really work as well as you would hope. First of all, there\u0026rsquo;s no option in the Conditional Formatting dialog box to specify an \u0026ldquo;unbold\u0026rdquo; style. You can only turn on the various styles. If you click More Formatting, you do get the option for a \u0026ldquo;Plain\u0026rdquo; style, but it is misleading: it doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually do anything. Besides, you don\u0026rsquo;t want plain text, you want italicized text. If you use conditional formatting to toggle text styles, you need to have the unstyled version on the layout and use a condition to apply the style. If you get confused trying to write your formula this way just remember you can put \u0026ldquo;not\u0026rdquo; in front of any boolean formula to reverse its meaning. Background Colors Although it isn\u0026rsquo;t immediately obvious, you can use conditional formatting to put background colors on the layout to call attention to a particular section of the screen. Since conditional formatting only applies to a few select objects, the trick is to find one that you can bend to your will. Take the text object: It is rectangular, you can make it any size and aspect ratio you want, and it can be formatted conditionally.\nIn other words, it makes a great little layout decorator. For example, suppose you want the entire CC Number section of the layout to highlight when the credit card has expired. It\u0026rsquo;s very easily done:\nIn layout mode, use the text tool to add a new text object in a convenient blank spot.\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter where you put it. You\u0026rsquo;re going to size and move it in a moment. Type a single space, then click outside the text object to finish editing.\nIf you leave it entirely blank, FileMaker assumes you made a mistake and deletes it. With a single space, it will be invisible, but it won\u0026rsquo;t get yanked. Using the Format → Conditional command, make this text object turn pale yellow with this condition formula: Customer::Expiration Date \u0026lt;= Get ( CurrentDate ). Then click OK.\nThis color will kick in when the card expires. Position the text object over the credit card information (fields, labels, and all), resize it so it fills the available space, and choose Arrange → Send to Back so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t cover the things it\u0026rsquo;s trying to highlight.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;ve completed these steps, switch to browse mode and find a record with an expired credit card. Figure 5 shows the result. Figure 5Using an almost-empty text object like wall paint, you can color sections of your layout for a very cool effect. In this case, since the credit card is expired, the entire credit card section of the layout highlights.\nNote: If you get even more creative, you can use this technique to make things completely disappear. Just put a clear text object right over the top of them, and set it to fill with a color that matches the background when you want the items hidden. Remember, though, that elements you hide this way are only invisible. They\u0026rsquo;re still there, and they can still be clicked, tabbed in to, or otherwise harassed. So this technique is really only suitable for non-enterable fields, pictures or icons, and blocks of text. Disabled Buttons One of the most frustrating symptoms of a static layout is buttons that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be clicked. Some FileMaker layouts have lots of buttons (after all, it\u0026rsquo;s all about functionality). And more often than not, some of those buttons don\u0026rsquo;t really make sense at any given moment. Maybe you have a button to email your student\u0026rsquo;s legal guardian that won\u0026rsquo;t work when the Email Address field is empty. Or perhaps the New Order button doesn\u0026rsquo;t do anything when the account is on hold. In cases like this, it would be fantastic if you could show your users that the button won\u0026rsquo;t work before they bother clicking it.\nIn your Customers database, for example, the New Ticket button already refuses to do its deed when the balance is gone (because that\u0026rsquo;s how the script it runs is written — we\u0026rsquo;re pretending here, remember?). But even with a zero balance, it sits there, bewitching your users with its clickable appeal. Luckily, everybody knows a button with a grayed-out label is off limits. Are you thinking what I\u0026rsquo;m thinking?\nUsing conditional formatting, make the button\u0026rsquo;s text color turn gray when Customers::Balance \u0026lt;= 0. As Figure 6 attests, this small change makes the layout decidedly more obvious.\nFigure 6You don\u0026rsquo;t have to be very anal to agree this version of the layout is much better. There\u0026rsquo;s no way in the world your sighted users would think they should click the New Ticket button. Tiny cues like this can mean the difference between frustration and felicity for your users.\nOf course you could use conditional formatting to call attention to a button instead. Maybe you want the New Payment button to brighten when in this situation. Brightly lit dynamic buttons are especially useful when your system has obvious next steps: Create Order, Post Payment, Send Shipment, for example.\nOne Last Hack There\u0026rsquo;s one compelling facet of conditional formatting that may be useful to the extra-imaginative developer. Unlike calculation-based formatting, conditional formatting on a field goes away as soon as you click into that field to make changes. Chances are good that industrious FileMaker gurus will come up with all kinds of interesting ways to take advantage of this fact.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s one small example: If you\u0026rsquo;re security-minded, that credit card number field might be making you nervous. There it sits, announcing sensitive information to any passersby. In today\u0026rsquo;s connected world, what are the chances someone will use remote control software to help out one of your users, and unwittingly see what should be secret? Or maybe your user will take a picture of the funny message on their screen and email it off to a dozen friends, not noticing the private information in the background.\nIn older versions of FileMaker, it was not uncommon to use white text to combat this kind of casual exposure. If the credit card number is white, and the field is white too, then it can\u0026rsquo;t be easily seen. But this technique has a glaring problem: You can\u0026rsquo;t see it when you need it either. Whether your user is trying to edit the number that\u0026rsquo;s there, or enter it into a credit card terminal, they\u0026rsquo;ll need some other way to see the information, which means more work for you.\nInstead, leave the text color set to black. But use conditional formatting to turn the text and fill colors light gray (or any other color you want) when the field is not empty (set the condition up to say \u0026ldquo;Value is not equal to\u0026rdquo; and leave the entry box blank.) Now the text is utterly invisible until you actually click into the field. And because the field is filled with color, your users know the number really is there when they need it. A truly empty field will be white instead. Check it out in Figure 7\nFigure 7Top: Because conditional formatting reverses itself when you click into the field, you can use it to mask sensitive information from sight. You can tell the Credit Card Number field here is not empty, because it\u0026rsquo;s filled with gray. But you can\u0026rsquo;t see the data. Bottom: When you click (or tab) into the field, the data instantly appears.\nConditional formatting is one of the neatest things to find its way into FileMaker in a long time. It\u0026rsquo;s simple, to be sure, but it can bring tangible improvements to almost any user-oriented layout. And it\u0026rsquo;s much more powerful than it might seem at first. With the skills and techniques you\u0026rsquo;ve learned here, you can start bringing your own layouts to life.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/advisor/bring-layouts-to-life-with-conditional-formatting/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Bring Layouts to Life with Conditional Formatting"},{"content":"A recent post on the TechNet mailing list posed an interesting question [ed: TechNet is now Claris Community. The link has been updated accordingly.]:\nWhen displaying an image in a web viewer, is there any way to scale the image to fit? Of course container fields have this ability built right in (by way of the Format → Graphic command). But there are several reasons you might want to show pictures in a web viewer instead. Most notably, the images might already be on a web site. There’s no reason to copy them into the FileMaker database too, wasting space and adding more to your already busy schedule. Is there any way to give web viewers container-like scaling ability?\nThis question inspired me, so I put together a solution that can be used generically. The result is a simple web page that can, using Javascript, load an image, figure out how big it is, and scale it appropriately. First, here’s the source of the page. If you’re curious about how it works, read on.\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \u0026#34;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\u0026#34; \u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;style\u0026gt; body { border: 0; margin: 0; } img { display: block; margin: 0 auto; } \u0026lt;/style\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script type=\u0026#34;text/javascript\u0026#34;\u0026gt; function resize_image() { var img = document.getElementsByTagName(\u0026#39;img\u0026#39;).item(0); if (img.offsetHeight \u0026gt; img.offsetWidth) img.style.height = \u0026#39;100%\u0026#39;; else img.style.width = \u0026#39;100%\u0026#39;; } \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body onload=\u0026#39;resize_image();\u0026#39;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script type=\u0026#34;text/javascript\u0026#34;\u0026gt; document.write( \u0026#34;\u0026lt;img src=\u0026#39;\u0026#34; + location.search.replace(/^\\?/, \u0026#34;\u0026#34;) + \u0026#34;\u0026#39;\u0026gt;\u0026#34; ); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; To use this in your own systems, copy the source code into a new file. Name it “scale-image.html” (or anything you want) and put it on your web server. To show a properly scaled image in a web viewer, you load this web page, and tell it what image to load in the query string (in other words, add a question mark and then the image URL to the end of the page URL). Sounds complicated, but really it isn’t. Here are a few examples:\n# Load an image with a complete URL: http://me.com/scale-image.html?http://foo.com/path/to/image.jpg # If the image is on the same web server: http://me.com/scale-image.html?/path/to/image.jpg # If the images are in the same folder as the page: http://me.com/scale-image.html?image.jpg Of course you can use any image type your browser supports: You’re not limited to JPEGs. Finally, note that this page only works properly if the web viewer itself is perfectly square (ie: 120px by 120px or 300px by 300px). Use the Object Info pallette (View → Object Info) to easily size your web viewer. If there is enough interest, I can revise the code to work in web viewers with any aspect ratio.\nHow Does it Work? If you’re new to dynamic HTML the web page may seem a little mysterious, but it is actually pretty easy to understand if you are familiar with HTML and Javascript. Let’s dissect it.\n[ed: This may be dynamic and HTML but it is not Dynamic HTML in the formal sense. I think I just didn\u0026rsquo;t know the details well enough when this was posted.]\nFirst, you see a pretty typical top-of-the-page. We declare the version of HTML we’re using, and start the page as normal.\nThe first important bit is this:\n\u0026lt;style\u0026gt; body { border: 0; margin: 0; } img { display: block; margin: 0 auto; } \u0026lt;/style\u0026gt; This embedded CSS stylesheet tells the web viewer a few important things:\nThe body part ensures the page body has no margin or padding. In other words, we want the contents of the page to push right up to the edge of the web viewer, with no gap. Normally, page content is indented a little on all sides, but we want our image to fill things up completely.\nThe display: block part tells the Web Viewer to treat images as block elements. This makes it possible for us to size and position the image precisely.\nThe margin: 0 auto part means the image should start at the very top of the web viewer (no top/bottom margin) and it should center itself right-to-left (automatic left and right margin).\nNext, we define a Javascript function. This code doesn’t run right away, but later it will be called. It does the actual work of resizing the image. Here’s the function:\n\u0026lt;script type=\u0026#34;text/javascript\u0026#34;\u0026gt; function resize_image() { var img = document.getElementsByTagName(\u0026#39;img\u0026#39;).item(0); if (img.offsetHeight \u0026gt; img.offsetWidth) img.style.height = \u0026#39;100%\u0026#39;; else img.style.width = \u0026#39;100%\u0026#39;; } \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; In CSS, if we set just the width of the image to 100% then the image will automatically be scaled so it is exactly the width of the web viewer. If you don’t set the height at all then the web viewer will keep the image’s aspect ratio. In other words, it will let the image be as tall as it needs to be so it doesn’t look squished. Likewise, if we set just the height to 100%, the width will scale accordingly. All we need to do is decide if the image should be just as wide as the web viewer, or just as tall.\n[ed: CSS has come a long way since this was posted. All this information is very out of date. Today you can simply use max-height: 100% and max-width: 100% on the image and the browser will do the right thing. No Javascript is needed here at all.]\nIf you think about it for a minute, you’ll agree that this depends on whether the image is taller than it is wide, or wider than it is tall. A tall image will fill the web viewer from top to bottom, and won’t be quite as wide as the web viewer itself. A wide image, on the other hand, will fill it from right to left, and be a little shorter.\nSo this function first get ahold of the image, storing a reference to it in a variable called img. It looks at the offsetHeight and offsetWidth of the image (these are just funny ways to refer to its height and width). If the height is bigger, it sets the height to 100%. If the width is bigger, it sets the width to 100% instead.\nRemember though that this function is only defined at this point. We haven’t actually run the code yet. The reason is simple: the image doesn’t exist yet. Next, the HTML looks like this:\nWarning: [ed: This is an elegant code snippet for a more civilized age. Today the internet is a wretched hive of scum and villainy and you should definitely not do this. This code unquestioningly inserts the text from the query string into the HTML body of a page, which is, like, the textbook definition of a CSRF attack. This code should be using document.createElement() to safely create images without injecting raw HTML. And it should be using some kind of allow-list or other checking to ensure only images coming from safe locations are displayed.] \u0026lt;body onload=\u0026#39;resize_image();\u0026#39;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script type=\u0026#34;text/javascript\u0026#34;\u0026gt; document.write( \u0026#34;\u0026lt;img src=\u0026#39;\u0026#34; + location.search.replace(/^\\?/, \u0026#34;\u0026#34;) + \u0026#34;\u0026#39;\u0026gt;\u0026#34; ); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; In this very short HTML body, we use another Javascript snippet. This time we generate an HTML img tag with a src attribute that refers to the image we’re supposed to load.\nThe image URL itself is loaded from the location.search property, which is just Javascript’s way of fetching the junk after the ? in the page URL. Unfortunately, the value in location.search includes the ? itself, so we use the replace function, with a regular expression to remove it.\nNow we have a web page with an image in it. If you look at the very top of the last code snippet, you’ll see where we call the resize_image function: in the body’s onload handler. This tells the web viewer to run the Javascript resize code only after the page (and the image on it) have finished loading.\nWhen the function runs, it adjusts the size setting for the image, and the image is properly scaled. Luckily, Javascript is very quick, so all you see is a perfectly scaled image from the start.\nThis sample was thrown together quickly, so it has room for improvement. To wit:\nThe web viewer has to be square. It would be better if it inspected the page size and adjusted its decision making accordingly, so it could scale an image in any size web viewer.\nThe image is centered left-to-right, but not top-to-bottom. Centering vertically in CSS is a bit of a nuisance, but there are several ways to do it, like this, this, and this. I think for the sake of simplicity, I would look at two approaches: Calculate the appropriate margin in Javascript, and set it; or just put the whole thing in a single-cell table. [ed: Or wait five of sixe years for CSS to catch up with reality. Vertical centering is now easy in CSS.]\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/sfr/scaling-images-in-a-web-viewer/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Scaling Images in a Web Viewer"},{"content":"One of the least talked about features of FileMaker 9 is a new calculation doodad called Self. Although the primary purpose of this function is to facilitate the Conditional Formatting feature (which can perform calculations on such unnamed items as text objects and buttons), Self comes in handy in lots of common situations.\nThe Self function is simple in concept: it returns the value of whatever object it lives in. For instance, if you put Self in a validation calculation, it will return the value in the field being validated.\nThis might seem a little…well..pointless. After all, there’s another way to get at that field’s value in a calculation: put the field name in the calculation.\nThe advantage of Self is subtle. Since you don’t have to refer to the field explicitly by name, you can easily copy and paste the formula somewhere else without the need to edit it. How often have you added the exact same validation calculation to several different fields? Before Self you had to adjust it in each field to refer to the correct value. With Self, the same formula — unchanged — works in each place.\nSelf has one more capability that’s a little less useful. When you use Conditional Formatting (Format → Conditional in layout mode), you can perform calculations on text objects and buttons. For example, if you apply conditional formatting to a text object, you can use Self in the condition formula. In that case, Self returns the contents of the text object itself. More specifically, it returns the browse mode contents. If the text object contains merge fields or other special symbols, the result of Self includes the actual replacement data.\nI’m not entirely sure what you’d ever do with that ability (and I’ve spent far too much time trying to think of something). If you find a cool use for it, let us know in the comments 😄\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/sfr/filemaker-9-tip-5-using-the-self-function/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"FileMaker 9 Tip #5: Using the Self Function"},{"content":"Another day, another awesome new FileMaker 9 feature. Today\u0026rsquo;s special: so called data URLs. In a nutshell, you don\u0026rsquo;t need a web site to use web viewers anymore. Now they can easily (read: without crazy exports and obscene path hacks) show data pulled right from the FileMaker database itself. This is, like, way cooler than it sounds.\nLive HTML Previews Perhaps the most immediately obvious way to use data URLs is to allow live preview of HTML data right in FileMaker. For example, suppose you allow your users to formulate styled HTML marketing emails in FileMaker, so they can easily be customized and sent to folks in your Customer table. You might have a layout that looks like this:\nThis probably-not-very-realistic database has a complete, well-formed HTML document in a single field.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s swell and all, but chances are your users have trouble visualizing all that HTML. With FileMaker 9, you can remodel that layout:\nAhh that\u0026rsquo;s more like it. Now the user can see if what they typed worked.\nIn the version above, you\u0026rsquo;ve added a tab control to switch between Source and Preview displays. The Preview tab is active in this picture, and you can see the actual HTML from the field rendered perfectly. Accomplishing this is astonishingly easy. Just use this calculation for your web viewer URL (assuming the HTML is in a field called Body Field:\n\u0026#34;data:text/html,\u0026#34; \u0026amp; Body Field\u0026#34; The key is the scheme data which tells the web viewer you\u0026rsquo;ll be sending the data of the page right there in the URL. The text/html bit tells FileMaker what kind of data you\u0026rsquo;re sending in. You can supply any standard media type you want, so long as you also provide proper data. In general, though, you\u0026rsquo;ll probably always use text/html because you can\u0026rsquo;t easily produce other kinds of data in a calculation.\nNote: Some of you may be thinking, \u0026ldquo;Hey, I could do this in 8.5 too!\u0026rdquo; and you\u0026rsquo;d be right—to a degree. In 8.5, data urls were partially implemented. They worked well on Mac OS X, and, with different syntax, on Windows. But they were very unreliable on Windows, and occasionally failed on the Mac as well. In FileMaker 9, data urls are reliable and consistent across both platforms— and ready for prime time. Dynamic Layout Displays Let\u0026rsquo;s be honest with each other. How often do you really have HTML in your database? I thought so. So is this whole data url thing a cool-but-useless novelty? Nope. If you get creative (and learn a little HTML) you suddenly realize you can do some seriously cool stuff. We\u0026rsquo;re not talking about dumping a web page on the layout. We\u0026rsquo;re talking about using the dynamic and flexible nature of HTML to present information in your database in ways that were never possible before.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a simple example. Suppose you have a database of product information, including total units sold for each of the last four months. You would like to show this info visually. Before FileMaker 9, you had a few choices:\nGenerate the charts on-by-one in Excel and import them back in to FileMaker Use a complicated and pricey plug-in Rely on a web-based service that may be slow and may not be accessible by the end user Do some seriously messed up stuff But with HTML, FileMaker 9, and some calculation prowess on your side, you can now solve this problem right at home. Here\u0026rsquo;s how:\nAssume you have four fields: Month 1 Sales, Month 2 Sales, Month 3 Sales, and Month 4 Sales. Each holds the total units sold in one month. You want to turn this data into an HTML page with four bars, one for each month. Here\u0026rsquo;s a rudimentary page:\n\u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;style\u0026gt; div { background: blue; position: absolute; width: 21.25%; bottom: 0; float: left; } \u0026lt;/style\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body style=\u0026#34;border: 0; margin: 0;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div style=\u0026#34;left: 0; height: 75%\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div style=\u0026#34;left: 26.25%; height: 15%\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div style=\u0026#34;left: 52.5%; height: 50%\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div style=\u0026#34;left: 78.75%; height: 100%\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; This page uses HTML DIV elements to display each bar. The DIVs are positioned at the bottom of the page, set with various heights, and spaced across the page evenly.\nNow your job is to create a FileMaker calculation that sends this data to the web viewer. This time, though, the height of each bar needs to be set based on the field values. You want the tallest bar to have a height of 100%, and you have four bars. This snippet shows how you calculate the height of each bar:\nLet( [max = Max(Customers::Month 1 Sales; Customers::Month 2 Sales; Customers::Month 3 Sales; Customers::Month 4 Sales); height_1 = Round(Customers::Month 1 Sales / max; 2); height_2 = Round(Customers::Month 2 Sales / max; 2); height_3 = Round(Customers::Month 3 Sales / max; 2); height_4 = Round(Customers::Month 4 Sales / max; 2)]; // use the height_n values here ) We first find the biggest bar. Then we calculate the height of each bar as a percentage of the largest. (The biggest will thus be 100%, and every other bar will be smaller.)\nNow, we combine the formulas with the web page (and add the necessary \u0026ldquo;data:\u0026rdquo;; bits):\n\u0026#34;data:text/html,\u0026#34; \u0026amp; Let( [max = Max(Customers::Month 1 Sales; Customers::Month 2 Sales; Customers::Month 3 Sales; Customers::Month 4 Sales); height_1 = Round(Customers::Month 1 Sales / max; 2); height_2 = Round(Customers::Month 2 Sales / max; 2); height_3 = Round(Customers::Month 3 Sales / max; 2); height_4 = Round(Customers::Month 4 Sales / max; 2)]; \u0026#34; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;style\u0026gt; div { background: blue; position: absolute; width: 21.25%; bottom: 0; float: left; } \u0026lt;/style\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body style=\\\u0026#34;border: 0; margin: 0;\\\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div style=\\\u0026#34;left: 0; height: \u0026#34; \u0026amp; (height_1 * 100) \u0026amp; \u0026#34;%\\\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div style=\\\u0026#34;left: 26.25%; height: \u0026#34; \u0026amp; (height_2 * 100) \u0026amp; \u0026#34;%\\\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div style=\\\u0026#34;left: 53.5%; height: \u0026#34; \u0026amp; (height_3 * 100) \u0026amp; \u0026#34;%\\\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div style=\\\u0026#34;left: 79.75%; height: \u0026#34; \u0026amp; (height_4 * 100) \u0026amp; \u0026#34;%\\\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; \u0026#34; ) When your done, you get something like this:\nWhat better way to visualize your data than visually?\nComplicated? Yes. But functional, real time, plug-in free, and not too complicated.\nTake me all the way You can use this generated HTML technique in infinite ways. For example, recently we posted an article on using web viewers as network-enabled container fields. That (pre FileMaker 9) technique required putting the helper file on a web server. You could eliminate that need, and make your system a little more portable, by generating the needed image scaling HTML right in the web viewer calculation.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a peek at another example that shows how dynamic HTML data can make layouts more dynamic than ever (this is a video, so click the play button):\nThis video show\u0026rsquo;s a more advanced interactive layout using a web viewer to show data from the database.\nThe new data url system in FileMaker unlocks huge potential. Here\u0026rsquo;s to many happy hours exploring that potential.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/sfr/filemaker-9-tip-9-web-viewers-without-the-web/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"FileMaker 9 Tip #9: Web Viewers Without the Web"},{"content":"So you’ve heard about the new FileMaker PHP API. You want to put FileMaker data on the web, but you’re not sure where to start. It can be a bit overwhelming at first, but using PHP to publish FileMaker to the web is easy, fun, and totally awesome. This (admittedly lengthy) article tells you everything you need to know to get started.\nWay back in version 4, FileMaker added built-in web publishing capabilities to FileMaker Pro. With a plug-in called the Web Companion, you could craft custom web pages that pulled data directly from a FileMaker Pro database to stay up-to-date. You could even build entire web sites that were completely managed by a database. This technology was massively popular because it let you publish your FileMaker Pro-based data and services to a broad audience in a form that anybody could handle. The world of FileMaker Web Publishing was born1, and people loved it.\nIt’s the End of the World as We Know It But this old-school web publishing had a major weakness: it was totally proprietary. As web application development grew in popularity, the importance of standardization also grew. The CDML language used to construct web pages was limited in its capabilities. FileMaker’s built-in web server (which was the only server capable of processing CDML) was anemic. To address these concerns FileMaker introduced a more powerful and standards-compliant web publishing technology with FileMaker Server 7 Advanced: XSLT web publishing. This technology used industry standard Apache and IIS web server software and the open standard XSLT language. Finally you could build fast, capable web pages with fewer limitations, and sill keep a direct connection to your FileMaker Pro database.\nUnfortunately, XSLT has its own major weakness: it is hard. XSLT is a complex and unintuitive language. It is well suited for the standardized transformation of one XML format to another (its primary purpose) but it is a poor fit for web application development. It is an especially bad choice for the FileMaker community, which is largely made up of real honest-to-goodness ordinary folks who don’t have a degree in Computer Science and just want simply powerful tools with which to get the job done.\nThe Perl Principle I never liked XSLT much. In what I believe is the best programming book ever written (the Camel Book), the authors outline a primary goal of the Perl programming language. They say Easy things should be easy, and hard things should be possible. I tend to think this rule should be applied to any technology you plan to spend your valuable time building with. FileMaker Pro passes this test beautifully, for example. But XSLT does not. In XSLT, even the easiest and most common things are a pain in the rump. But alas, I digress. When XSLT replaced CDML back in 2004, web publishing with FileMaker came to a virtual standstill. Instead of the fun, learnable CDML development process, experienced web publishers and new users alike were forced to wade through all the complexities of XSLT and many simply gave up.\nHope on the Horizon These days you don’t have to look far to find easy, powerful, standards-based web technologies. For instance, something like 234 trillion people use PHP, a super-capable, super-fast, totally standard web programming language that powers everything from Wikipedia to The Roald Dahl Fan Site. Best of all, PHP is infinitely simpler than XSLT. It works the way you would expect: you write some HTML, and add a little code here and there to produce the dynamic parts2. Best of all, PHP is well documented on-line (php.net) and in hundreds of books, magazines, and blogs.\nFileMaker noticed that nobody was bothering with XSLT anymore, so they took the plunge and created the FileMaker API for PHP, heretofor called the PHP API. It adds a series of special commands3 to the PHP language that make it a breeze to talk to your FileMaker database right in your PHP code. This is a big deal. It means that ordinary FileMaker users now have an easy and inexpensive way to get back in to web publishing. I’m looking forward to a second renaissance: FileMaker web publishing will be loved by all again. This article will get you up to speed on the PHP API.\nSetup and Configuration Before you can actually start writing code, you need a few critical pieces. They are:\nA web server. Mac OS X users are in luck: the Apache web server is built right in to your computer. If you use Windows, you’ll need a server version with IIS. The PHP Mojo. You next need to install PHP and the FileMaker API for PHP on your computer. You can sign up for the public beta directly from FileMaker. Once you sign up, FileMaker will email you a link to download the software. Unless you are completely positive you know what you’re doing you should choose the “If you are new to PHP” version. This download will install and configure PHP for your computer, and install the API add-ons in just the right spot. FileMaker Server Advanced. Like all FileMaker web publishing, the PHP API requires the Web Publishing Engine, which is a part of FileMaker Server Advanced. Only this (more expensive) version of FileMaker Server has the XML capabilities the PHP API depends on to do its job. Update May 9, 2008: I can’t believe I haven’t mentioned this before now, but point #3 above is no longer valid. As of FileMaker Server 9.0, the PHP API can be used with the standard FileMaker Server product, so save some money and don’t bother buying the Advanced version. Once you have installed and configured the Web Publishing Engine according to the documentation, it will be preconfigured to allow the PHP API to work. If you have modified the configuration, though, you’ll need to log in to the Web Publishing Engine console and make sure Custom Web Publishing with XML is turned on.\nThis article won’t go in to setting up and configuring web servers. Before you continue, you should have PHP and the FileMaker API for PHP installed and working, and you should know where to put php files so they are accessible by the web server (/Library/WebServer/Documents on Mac OS X, usually C:/inetpub/wwwroot on Windows).\nA Brief Introduction to PHP If you are new to PHP, this section will attempt to bring you up to speed quickly. But bear in mind that PHP is a vast language with tons of functionality. The ultimate resource is the php manual at php.net. Although you’ll get enough info here to make a working PHP web page, you’ll need to do more reading to get really comfortable with the language. On the other hand, if you’re already a php whiz, you can skip right to the next section.\nPHP is a template based scripting language. A .php file is really just an ordinary text file that tells PHP what kind of text you want to produce. In fact, this is a perfectly valid PHP file:\nhello world If you put a file like that on your web server and view it with a web browser, you’ll see just the words “hello world” on the page. With no special instructions, PHP simply spits out all the text in the file. But that’s not terribly exciting. After all, you could avoid PHP entirely if you just wanted to put some static text on the web page. The magic of PHP comes in to play when you insert these special tags in your page: \u0026lt;?php and ?\u0026gt; . The things you put between these tags are not simply sent to the browser like plain text. Rather, they are interpreted by the PHP system. You put scripting code between these tags, and PHP runs your scripts. The scripts themselves can output information using the echo command. Here is a PHP file with an embedded script:\n\u0026lt;?php echo \u0026#34;hello world\u0026#34; ?\u0026gt; This script does exactly the same thing as the last one. But it does it by running a snippet of script that uses the echo command to put the message on the page. Embedded PHP scripts can do a whole lot more than echo text to the page though. They can perform decision making logic, do math, send email, and (using the FileMaker API for PHP) they can even run a FileMaker script and extract the record data it finds. Here is a PHP file that does a little more:\n\u0026lt;?php $hour = date(\u0026#34;G\u0026#34;); if ($hour \u0026lt; 12) echo \u0026#34;good morning world\u0026#34;; elseif ($hour \u0026lt; 18) echo \u0026#34;good afternoon world\u0026#34;; else echo \u0026#34;good evening world\u0026#34;; ?\u0026gt; This sample adds some intelligence to your evolving site. Now it says “good morning world” when the hour of the day is less than 12. It gives a more appropriate “good afternoon world” between noon and 6:00 PM. Finally, after 6 it says “good evening world.” In this sample, you can see some of the basics of the PHP language. First, $hour is a variable (all PHP variables start with $ just like script variables in FileMaker). The line $hour = date(\u0026quot;G\u0026quot;) creates the $hour variable and sets its value. It uses the date() function to find the current hour. You can read more about the date function here. (In fact, you can get comprehensive documentation on any function in PHP by searching the php web site). In this case, the \u0026quot;G\u0026quot; being passed to the date() function tells PHP you want just the hours, in 24 hour format.\nYou can also see PHP’s if syntax. The first line checks to see if the $hour variable is less than 12. If so, the first echo line kicks in. Just like FileMaker’s If script step, PHP’s has an elseif companion for adding additional conditions. Unfortunately, unlike ScriptMaker, with PHP you have to know what to type: you don’t get a handy point-and-click guide to all the syntax. But with a little patience, exploration of the examples in this article, and some time spent on php.net or with a good book, you too can be a PHP expert.\nPreparing your Database Before PHP can talk to your particular database, you need to set up the appropriate privileges. The PHP API looks for its own special extended privilege in FileMaker before it is allowed to do its work. Your job is twofold: define the appropriate extended privilege, and grant that privilege to a privilege set.\nOpen your database in FileMaker Pro.\nYou should see your database window. Choose File → Define → Accounts \u0026amp; Privileges.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Accounts and Privileges dialog box appears. Switch to the Extended Privileges tab.\nYou see a (probably empty) list of extended privileges. Click New.\nA window appears where you can enter custom privileges. In the Keyword box, enter fmphp.\nThis is the keyword you need in place for the PHP API to work with your database. You can put anything you want in the Description box, for example Access via PHP Web Publishing. Click OK.\nFileMaker saves this new privilege. Now that the appropriate extended privilege is defined, you need to grant this privilege to some privilege set. Here, you have a decision to make. If your site is going to be available to the public or to lots of users who don’t have accounts in FileMaker, then you should create a new account and a new privilege set. Give the privilege set only the permissions it needs for your web pages to work (including the fmphp extended privilege and access to the records and fields that will be used on the web). Then you can hard-code the PHP code to use this username and password. This is the most common method, and the one you’ll use in this article.\nOn the other hand, if your web users are the same folks who use FileMaker Pro directly, you can give the fmphp extended privilege to your existing privilege sets. You’ll also have to use a log in form on your PHP web site to ask for the username and password so FileMaker can connect.\nFor this article, create a new account with the username php and a good password. Assign this account to a new privilege set, called PHP Access. When defining the privilege set, use these options:\nIn the Records pop-up menu, choose “Create, edit, and delete in all tables.” In the Layouts pop-up menu, choose “All view only.” In the Value Lists pop-up menu, choose “All view only.” In the Scripts pop-up menu, choose “All executable only.” In the Extended Privileges list, turn off “Access via FileMaker Network (fmapp)” and turn on your fmphp extended privilege. When you’re finished setting up privileges, click OK a half-dozen times to dismiss all the open dialog boxes.\nMaking the Connection to FileMaker PHP has thousands of built in functions covering more territory than Lewis and Clark. But one thing it doesn’t have built in is a connect_to_filemaker_pro() function. Instead, you use the classes in the PHP API to talk to your FileMaker Pro databases. Before you can do anything with FileMaker, though, you need to make a connection. It is simple:\n$connection =\u0026amp; new FileMaker(\u0026#39;My Database\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;myserver\u0026#39;); This little snippet of PHP code creates a FileMaker object that represents the connection to the database. You pass in the name of your database, and the address of your Web Publishing Engine server. The object is stored in a variable called $connection (although you can call this variable anything you want). It is important to note that this command doesn’t actually talk to FileMaker. Instead, it gets ready to talk to FileMaker by storing the appropriate connection information.\nThe first thing you probably want to do with this object is tell it what username and password to use. You do that thusly:\n$connection-\u0026gt;setProperty(\u0026#39;username\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;php\u0026#39;); $connection-\u0026gt;setProperty(\u0026#39;password\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;mypassword\u0026#39;); The object stored in $connection has a few methods, or built-in functions, that work with the connection. In this case you’re calling the setProperty method twice. (You call a method using the arrow operator: -\u0026gt;. You can see it right between $connection and setProperty.) First to set the username, and then to set the password. You’ll of course substitute your real password for mypassword here.\nFinding and Displaying Record Data Now the PHP API has all the information it needs to talk to your database. You only need to tell it what to say. The most common thing you’ll do in a PHP page is find some records. You do that with the newFindCommand method:\n$cmd =\u0026amp; $connection-\u0026gt;newFindCommand(‘My Layout’); $cmd-\u0026gt;addFindCriterion(‘First Name’, ‘Sophia’); $cmd-\u0026gt;addFindCriterion(‘Last Name’, ‘Coffey’); $result = $cmd-\u0026gt;execute(); The newFindCommand method expects just one parameter, the name of a layout in your database. FileMaker figures out which table to search and which fields to return based on this layout. newFindCommand returns a command object, which you store in a variable called $cmd.\nLayouts and PHP Before you move on, think hard about what you just did. The fact that you specify a layout for PHP to use raises some important considerations:\nIf you remove a field from a layout, that field is no longer sent back to PHP pages that use that layout, even if the field is still in the database. This could break the page. If you delete a layout, PHP pages that use it will stop working. If you add fields to a layout, the new data will be sent back to PHP pages, although the pages don’t do anything with it. This makes the PHP to FileMaker communication slower without adding any benefit, especially if you add summary fields, complex calculation fields, or large portals. With these in mind, you’ll understand why it is a good idea to create special layouts specifically for PHP to use. Then you can modify your ordinary layouts without worrying about breaking the pages. And your php-specific layouts can be as trim as possible to keep things running quickly. You could, for example, add a web_contact layout to your contact manager database, and include only the fields you want to show on the web.\nThe second and third lines in this example tell FileMaker what to search for. Using the addFindCriterion method, you specify what field to search in, and what value to search for. In this case, you’re asking for records with “Sophia” in the First Name field and “Coffey” in the Last Name field.\nThe last line calls the execute method on the command object. Here, for the first time, the PHP API actually talks to FileMaker. It tells your database to go to the My Layout layout, find all the appropriate records, and send them back. The result (a result object) is stored in the $result variable, ready for you to access.\nChecking for Errors When you call the execute method on a command object, you can actually get one of two possible responses. You usually get a set of records. But you could get an error instead. Errors arise if the Web Publishing Engine isn’t reachable, the layout couldn’t be found, the find criteria was invalid, or simply if no records were found. Before you begin digging for records, then, you need to check for errors. You can make the check easily enough using the FileMaker::isError function. You get errors most often when you’re first building a page, as you work out mistakes in your code. When these kinds of errors crop up, it is exceptionally helpful if you get the PHP code to show you information about the error message, so you’re not left wondering what went wrong. So initially, you should use this boilerplate error handling code:\nif (FileMaker::isError($result)) { echo \u0026#39;unable to find Sophia Coffey: \u0026#39; . $result-\u0026gt;message . \u0026#39;(\u0026#39; . $result-\u0026gt;code . \u0026#39;)\u0026#39;; die(); } This code checks to see if the result represents an error (notice that your $result variable is being sent to the FileMaker::isError function). If so, it dumps out a meaningful error message to the page. This message includes the $result-\u0026gt;message and $result-\u0026gt;code values, which are the english-language error message numerical code associated with the error. The die function tells PHP to stop processing the page. The errors tend to fall in to two categories:\nSometimes the error will have no code (in parentheses at the very end of the error message). These errors usually mention having trouble communicating with the “host”. This means the PHP API couldn’t talk to your Web Publishing Engine for some reason. Make sure the address is correct, Custom Web Publishing with XML is turned on, your username and password are correct (including case for the password) and that the account has the fmphp extended privilege. Other errors, which do have a code at the end, are FileMaker errors. FileMaker told the PHP API it couldn’t perform the requested action for some reason. This is almost always because of a typo in your code or some other mistake on your end. For example, if you misspell a field name in your find criteria, you’ll get a Field not Found error. The notable exception is error number 401. This just means no records were found, which may be a reasonable outcome for your web site. You’ll learn how to deal with this particular error shortly. If you get a FileMaker error code, you should promptly go to Google and search for “FileMaker Error Code X” (only put the real code in place of the X). This will undoubtedly find the page on briandunning.com where you’ll find a plain-english explanation of the problem. Think about the error you’re getting and see if you can spot where in your code you made a mistake.\nThe one error code you probably don’t want to show on the web page is FileMakers “No records found” error (401). You can easily enhance your error handling code to deal with this case:\nif (FileMaker::isError($result)) { if ($result-\u0026gt;code != 401) { echo \u0026#39;unable to find Sophia Coffey: \u0026#39; . $result-\u0026gt;message . \u0026#39;(\u0026#39; . $result-\u0026gt;code . \u0026#39;)\u0026#39;; die(); } else $notFound = true; } This version only sends back an error message (and aborts the page) if the error code is not 401. If you do get a 401 error, it sets a $notFound variable to true but lets the page continue to process. You’ll use this $notFound variable later to avoid asking for records that don’t exist.\nAccessing Record Data Once you’ve confirmed that you didn’t get an error, you’re ready to look at the records you got back. The result object has a getRecords method for just this purpose. It returns a PHP array of record objects. You can then use the getField method on a record object to access actual field data. Here’s an example that puts information from the first record on the page:\n$records = $result-\u0026gt;getRecords(); echo \u0026#39;First Name: \u0026#39; . $records[0]-\u0026gt;getField(\u0026#39;First Name\u0026#39;) . \u0026#39;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026#39;; echo \u0026#39;Last Name: \u0026#39; . $records[0]-\u0026gt;getField(\u0026#39;Last Name\u0026#39;) . \u0026#39;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026#39;; echo \u0026#39;Email Address: \u0026#39; . $records[0]-\u0026gt;getField(\u0026#39;Email Address\u0026#39;) . \u0026#39;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026#39;; In PHP, arrays start with zero, so the last three lines of this sample use the expression $records[0] to fetch the first record. In each case, the getField method grabs a field value, which is echo’d onto the page. (The . operator in PHP is like FileMaker’s \u0026amp; operator: it concatenates text. So each echo line here actually prints out a label, then the field value, then an HTML \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; tag.)\nMore often than not, you want to show all the records instead. To do so, you use a PHP foreach loop:\n$records = $result-\u0026gt;getRecords(); foreach ($records as $record) { echo \u0026#39;First Name: \u0026#39; . $record-\u0026gt;getField(\u0026#39;First Name\u0026#39;) . \u0026#39;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026#39;; echo \u0026#39;Last Name: \u0026#39; . $record-\u0026gt;getField(\u0026#39;Last Name\u0026#39;) . \u0026#39;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026#39;; echo \u0026#39;Email Address: \u0026#39; . $record-\u0026gt;getField(\u0026#39;Email Address\u0026#39;) . \u0026#39;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026#39;; echo \u0026#39;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026#39;; } This time, PHP loops through every record that was found, and puts the name and email information from each one on the page. Notice that inside the foreach loop, you have a new variable called $record (singular) that holds just one record object, so you no longer need the [0] from the previous example.\nUsing the information you’ve gotten so far, you can do a lot. You could build an entire web site that gets live, up-to-the-minute data right from your database and mixes it right into the web pages. But the PHP API lets you go far beyond just finding data.\nOther Command Types In the last section, you used the FileMaker object’s newFindCommand to create a command object that finds records. The PHP API has several other methods for additional command types. The more common types are explained here.\nTip: You can also see all the PHP API’s various objects and methods by viewing the “API Docs” that were installed with the API on your web server computer. On Mac OS X, this can be found in /Library/FileMaker Server/Web Publishing/FileMaker API for PHP Docs/apidoc. On Windows, look in C:\\Program Files\\FileMaker\\FileMaker Server\\Web Publishing\\FileMaker API for PHP Docs\\apidocs. In either folder, find the “index.html” file and open it with a web browser. Adding New Records Use the newAddCommand to add records to the database. Again, you specify the layout to use. This time, though, you use the setField method on the command object to specify the actual field values that should go in the new record.\n$cmd = $connection-\u0026gt;newAddCommand(\u0026#39;My Layout\u0026#39;); $cmd-\u0026gt;setField(\u0026#39;First Name\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Isabel\u0026#39;); $cmd-\u0026gt;setField(\u0026#39;Last Name\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Coffey\u0026#39;); $result = $cmd-\u0026gt;execute(); Just like with the find command, you need to check for errors after you execute. If all went well, the result object will hold the record that was added. You can inspect this object to see information that was auto-entered, like serial numbers.\nDeleting Records To delete a record, use the newDeleteCommand method. This method expects two parameters. In addition to the layout name, you must provide the record id of the record you want to delete. This is not the value from you ID field or other serial number field. Instead, this is the internal id that FileMaker gives the record without your knowledge. You can find the record id for a record in PHP using the getRecordId method on the record object (You can also get a record id from within FileMaker itself using the Get(RecordId) fucntion in the Specify Calculation window):\n$records = $result-\u0026gt;getRecords(); $recordId = $records[0]-\u0026gt;getRecordId(); So deleting a record is usually a two-step process. First, you have to find the record you want to delete, so you can ask for its ID. Then you have to delete the record. Here’s an example that shows the whole process:\n$cmd = $connection-\u0026gt;newFindCommand(\u0026#39;My Layout\u0026#39;); $cmd-\u0026gt;setField(\u0026#39;First Name\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Roger\u0026#39;); $cmd-\u0026gt;setField(\u0026#39;Last Name\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Coffey\u0026#39;); $result = $cmd-\u0026gt;execute(); if (FileMaker::isError($result)) { echo \u0026#39;unable to find the record to delete: \u0026#39; . $result-\u0026gt;message . \u0026#39;(\u0026#39; . $result-\u0026gt;code . \u0026#39;)\u0026#39;; die(); } $records = $result-\u0026gt;getRecords(); $recordId = $records[0]-\u0026gt;getRecordId(); $cmd = $connection-\u0026gt;newDeleteCommand(\u0026#39;My Layout\u0026#39;, $recordId); $result = $cmd-\u0026gt;execute(); if (FileMaker::isError($result)) { echo \u0026#39;unable to delete the record: \u0026#39; . $result-\u0026gt;message . \u0026#39;(\u0026#39; . $result-\u0026gt;code . \u0026#39;)\u0026#39;; die(); } Editing Existing Records Editing a record works a little like adding a record, and a little like deleting. You need to specify the field values just like you did when you added a record. And you need to tell FileMaker which record to edit using a record id, just as with the delete command. Here’s how it works:\n$cmd = $connection-\u0026gt;newFindCommand(\u0026#39;My Layout\u0026#39;); $cmd-\u0026gt;setField(\u0026#39;First Name\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Melinda\u0026#39;); $cmd-\u0026gt;setField(\u0026#39;Last Name\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Coffey\u0026#39;); $result = $cmd-\u0026gt;execute(); if (FileMaker::isError($result)) { echo \u0026#39;unable to find the record to edit: \u0026#39; . $result-\u0026gt;message . \u0026#39;(\u0026#39; . $result-\u0026gt;code . \u0026#39;)\u0026#39;; die(); } $records = $result-\u0026gt;getRecords(); $recordId = $records[0]-\u0026gt;getRecordId(); $cmd = $connection-\u0026gt;newEditCommand(\u0026#39;My Layout\u0026#39;, $recordId); $cmd-\u0026gt;setField(\u0026#39;First Name\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Mamie\u0026#39;); $result = $cmd-\u0026gt;execute(); if (FileMaker::isError($result)) { echo \u0026#39;unable to edit the record: \u0026#39; . $result-\u0026gt;message . \u0026#39;(\u0026#39; . $result-\u0026gt;code . \u0026#39;)\u0026#39;; die(); } This sample finds Melinda Coffey in the database, and changes their first name to Mamie. The result object, if successful, contains the newly edited record.\nRunning a Script No FileMaker API would be complete without the ability to run a FileMaker script. The PHP API makes this a breeze. Just tell it which layout to switch to, which script to run, and (optionally) what parameter to send to the script:\n$cmd = $connection-\u0026gt;newPerformScriptCommand(\u0026#39;My Layout\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;My Script\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;My Parameter\u0026#39;); $result = $cmd-\u0026gt;execute(); As always, you should check the result for errors. If none occurred, the result object will hold all the records that were found after the script finished. If your script doesn’t need a parameter, you can leave that part out entirely, like this:\n$cmd = $connection-\u0026gt;newPerformScriptCommand(\u0026#39;My Layout\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;My Script\u0026#39;); $result = $cmd-\u0026gt;execute(); Paging Through Records Sometimes you have so many records in your database, that it isn’t realistic to put them all on one web page. The find command object has the ability to limit how many records are returned in cases like this. You give the find command a skip value and a max value. For example, if you want the first 100 records, tell it to skip 0 (zero) and include a max of 100. To get the next page-full, perform the same find command again, but this time set the skip to 100. The max should be 100 again. This time FileMaker will give you records 101 through 200. You set these parameters using the setRange method on the command object:\n$cmd =\u0026amp; $connection-\u0026gt;newFindCommand(\u0026#39;My Layout\u0026#39;); $cmd-\u0026gt;addFindCriterion(\u0026#39;Last Name\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Coffey\u0026#39;); $cmd-\u0026gt;setRange(0, 100); $result = $cmd-\u0026gt;execute(); In this example, the skip value is 0 and the max value is 100. If you don’t call setRange, FileMaker includes every record in the result. For large sets of records, this can be very slow.\nPutting it All Together In this article you have seen the basic features of the FileMaker API for PHP. By combining the various FileMaker commands on several PHP pages, you can build a web site that can interact completely with your FileMaker database, including finding and displaying records, editing them, deleting them, and adding new records. This can come in the form of a straight-forward data management interface (that anyone with a web browser can use) or it can happen behind the scenes while your web users interact with a service-oriented web site.\nFootnotes Truth be told, FileMaker Web Publishing has a history that starts well before the Web Companion in FileMaker 4. But that’s a story for another day. ↩ There are many other fantastic web languages available to pick from. But none of them has the official stamp of approval from FileMaker. PHP is the best choice here simply because FileMaker has done all the hard work to get it to talk to your database. ↩ More correctly, the API is a set of classes for PHP. Like many languages, PHP has a smattering of so-called object-oriented capabilities. FileMaker wrote PHP object types specifically for communicating with a FileMaker Pro database. You can read more about PHP classes in the PHP Manual. ↩ ","img":false,"link":"/archive/sfr/up-to-speed-with-the-filemaker-php-api/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Up To Speed with the FileMaker PHP API"},{"content":"If you\u0026rsquo;ve used a computer sometime in the last five years, chances are you\u0026rsquo;ve seen tooltips. These informational little boxes pop up to help you out when you point at just about anything on the computer screen, from a toolbar icon to a truncated file name (Figure 1). Tooltips are so common, in fact, that many users know to look for them whenever they\u0026rsquo;re not sure what a particular button, icon, slider, or knob will do.\nFigure 1Whether your users are on Mac OS X or Windows, they are exposed to tooltips every day. The top picture shows a tooltip in the Finder on Mac OS X. The bottom picture has a tooltip in Internet Explorer on Windows Vista.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve probably seen tooltips in FileMaker Pro before too: they pop up when you point to items in the tool bar. What you may not realize, though, is that with FileMaker Pro Advanced 8.0 or later, you can add your own custom tooltips to your database solutions. If you have icons to represent different sections of your system, for example, you can tell FileMaker to show a tooltip with the text you specify whenever the user holds her mouse arrow over the icon.\nTooltips are a fantastic user interface enhancement because they make your database easier for beginners to learn by providing targeted help for any item that might need explaining. At the same time, they don\u0026rsquo;t clutter the interface for more advanced users. In fact, your power users can cruise through your layouts and never know the tooltips are there. And best of all, they\u0026rsquo;re super easy to add to your existing databases.\nAdding Tooltips to Your Layouts Before you start adding tooltips, you need to make sure you have FileMaker Pro Advanced. Although users with the basic version of FileMaker Pro can see the tooltips you define, you must have the Advanced version to define them in the first place. Once you have your database open in Advanced, you can assign a tooltip to any element on any layout. The simplest example is a button. Suppose you have a button on your layout that is a picture of a letter and envelope. You know that this button creates a new email message for the person in the database, but your user may not know this. To add a helpful tip to this button, follow these steps:\nSwitch to Layout Mode, navigate to the correct layout, and select the button.\nWhen the button is selected, FileMaker will show little square \u0026quot;handles\u0026quot; on its four corners. From the Format menu, choose Set Tooltip\u0026hellip;\nThe \u0026ldquo;Set Tooltip\u0026rdquo; dialog box appears. Enter \u0026ldquo;Create a new email message for this person.\u0026rdquo; in the Set Tooltip dialog box, then click OK\nThe dialog box closes and you\u0026rsquo;re back on the layout. Nothing has changed yet because tooltips only show in Browse mode. Now if you switch back to browse mode, point to the button with your mouse, and wait a few seconds, the tooltip will appear. You can see it in Figure 2 as well.\nFigure 2Using a custom tooltip, this FileMaker database now teaches the user what the Email button does. Without the tooltip, the simple icon could confuse a new user.\nDynamic Data in Tooltips Often, a tooltip is just as simple as this: a single piece of text that always shows when you point to a button. But your tooltips can be more dynamic if you want. For example, the tooltip you just created might be better if it told the user who the email would be addressed to. FileMaker provides the full power of its calculation engine to tooltip text, so this is easily done. Just select the button and choose Format → Set Tooltip\u0026hellip; again. This time, though, don\u0026rsquo;t simply type in the empty box. Instead, click the Specify\u0026hellip; button. FileMaker shows you the standard Specify Calculaiton dialog box. You can use any calculation you want. When FileMaker shows the tooltip, it will evaluate the calculaiton and display the result. For example, you could use this calculation for your Email button:\n\u0026#34;Create a new email message for \u0026#34; \u0026amp; Contacts::First Name \u0026amp; \u0026#34; \u0026#34; \u0026amp; Contacts::Last Name \u0026amp; \u0026#34;.\u0026#34; Now when you test your tooltip, it will include the name of the person who will be emailed, giving the user a little more information.\nTurning Tooltips On and Off Dynamically Occasionally a tooltip that makes sense most of the time doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense in certain situations. For example, your email button doesn\u0026rsquo;t work if the person has no email address. If the user points to the button by an empty email address field, the tooltip will incorrectly claim that the button will create an email message.\nYou may be tempted to make the tooltip slightly more dynamic; In other words, you can include a different message if the Email Address field is empty. You already know how to do this using a calculation like this:\nIf (IsEmpty(Email Address), \u0026#34;This person has no Email Address.\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Create a new email message for \u0026#34; \u0026amp; Contacts::First Name \u0026amp; \u0026#34; \u0026#34; \u0026amp; Contacts::Last Name \u0026amp; \u0026#34;.\u0026#34; ) The tooltip will now show one of two different messages, depending on what\u0026rsquo;s in the Email Address field.\nBut in some cases, it would be better if the tooltip simply didn\u0026rsquo;t show up in a case like this. In other words, it would be nice if you could turn the tooltip off if the email address field is empty. In fact, this is easy to do: Whenever your tooltip calculation has no result (or results in just \u0026ldquo;\u0026rdquo;) FileMaker won\u0026rsquo;t show the tooltip at all. This way your user only sees a tooltip when the button will actulaly do something. To get this behavior, you can use a calculation like this:\nIf (Not IsEmpty(Email Address)), \u0026#34;Create a new email message for \u0026#34; \u0026amp; Contacts::First Name \u0026amp; \u0026#34; \u0026#34; \u0026amp; Contacts::Last Name \u0026amp; \u0026#34;.\u0026#34; ) As you can see, this calculation has no result if the Email Address field is empty. Similarly, if you want to remove the tooltip for an object, return to the Set Tooltip dialog box and empty out the Tooltip calculaiton. An empty calculation never has a value, and so the tooltip never shows.\nAdvanced Tooltips It is also important to note that tooltips aren\u0026rsquo;t limited to buttons. You can put a tooltip on any object on a FileMaker layout. For example, you could include special instructions for a specific field by assigning a tooltip to the field itself, or explain what records are showing in a portal by assiging a tooltip to it.\nAs you add tooltips to your database, it can quickly get difficult to keep track of what has a tooltip and what doesn\u0026rsquo;t. To deterine if an item has a tooltip, it seems like you have to select it, choose the Format → Set Tooltip menu command, and check the contents of the Tooltip box. That\u0026rsquo;s a lot of work, and a layout can have hundreds of objects. Luckily, FileMaker makes it much easier. When in layout mode, choose View → Show → Tooltips. When this option is turned on, FileMaker puts a little yellow sticky note icon next to each object that has a tooltip. These icons only show in Layout mode, so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about them disrupting your pristine user interface, but they serve as a handy reminder as you customize the layout. This is especially useful when you duplicate an item. If you duplicate a field with a tooltip, the tooltip comes along with it, but this is rarely what you want. When tooltips are showing in Layout mode, you are reminded to remove the tooltip from the new copy.\nWhen to Use Tooltips Some say that tooltips should only be used to provide help or tips about the use of the system. For example, explanations of what to type in a field, what a button does, and where a piece of information comes from are all good tooltip candidates. On the other hand, most user interface experts caution that a tooltip should not be the source of actual information. Your email program probably doesn\u0026rsquo;t use tooltips to show you how many email messages you have, or who wrote a particular message.\nThis guideline is based on two simple facts: First, there is no way to tell by looking whether a particular element will have a tooltip or not. For example, the Email button looks just the same now as it did before you gave it a tooltip. So it isn\u0026rsquo;t obvious to the user that more information might exist under the covers. Second, tooltips can be slow since you can\u0026rsquo;t click anything to make them show. Instead you have to point and wait. That little two second wait can seem like an eternity if you have to do it all day long to get at critical information you need to do your job. On the other hand, if the tooltip only shows information useful for new users, it is easily accessible, but will never slow down a power user.\nThis rule makes good sense for database systems that you sell to end users. After all, this is how most desktop applications work, and it is better for you and your users if your application feels familiar to a novice. So if you don\u0026rsquo;t work directly with your end users, you should probably stick to help-only tooltips.\nOn the other hand, if your database is used by people in your company, and will be a major part of their day-to-day activities (as is often the case with a FileMaker database) you might be able to bend this rule somewhat. Most systems in this category are used by a small number of people all day long, and those users have ample opportunity to train on the ideosyncrasies of the system. As such, it might make sense to make more liberal use of tooltips. You can always train the user to know where to look, making the first tooltip concern a non-issue. And as long as the data in the tooltip is not the most critical and often-needed information, the user won\u0026rsquo;t need to visit it often, making the short delay acceptable.\nIn an environment like this, it might make sense to include record access information (last modified by, and so forth), extra details about a record (lesser-needed fields that don\u0026rsquo;t fit on the portal, for example), and other non-critical data in your tooltips. They are a super-convenient way to tuck some information out of site and leave it in an easy-to-reach spot. Best of all, when your user gets the data they need from a tooltip, they don\u0026rsquo;t have to leave the current layout and potentially lose track of where they are in the system.\nTooltips are powerful, user-friendly, and familiar user interface elements that are drop-dead easy to take advantage of with FileMaker Pro Advanced 8.0 or 8.5. If you have lots of users, or value efficiency, chances are you can find a handful of ways to make your solution easier to understand and use with a sprinkling of tooltips on your layouts.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/advisor/use-tooltips-to-guide-your-users/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Use Tooltips to Guide Your Users"},{"content":"The fastest growing platform for data-rich interactive applications is not Microsoft Window, Mac OS X, or Linux. Instead, more and more businesses turn to the Web to deploy software systems. Theses so-called “Web Applications” are not limited to high-traffic public Internet services (like Google, MapQuest, or the Internet Movie Database). A web-based system can be made available only to key partners, clients, off-site employees, or even just in-office users.\nAlthough developing a web-enabled database is sometimes not as simple, straightforward, or inexpensive as a traditional FileMaker database, in certain circumstances, it is an excellent option. For example:\nSince the Web is built on free open standards, a web enabled database can be made accessible to anybody on just about any platform, with no special software requirements (aside from a good web browser). In other words, your clients can get access to parts of your database without installing FileMaker Pro. Because the Web was designed with slow connections in mind, a web based system can perform equally well for employees in the building and salespeople on the road with less-than-perfect wide band internet access. Web enabled systems can make it possible to tie different systems together through internet standards like XML, RSS, and REST. If you want to get started making these ideas work for you, your best first step is this Whitepaper. Here you’ll learn exactly what FileMaker can do on the web, and how to get your databases there.\nLuckily, as a FileMaker developer, you are positioned perfectly to take advantage of all these technologies. FileMaker actually has four distinct web-enabling technologies readily available. Each is designed to meet a particular need; from the one-click simplicity of Instant Web Publishing to an XML publishing option only a true geek could love. And you can rest assured FileMaker is up to the task. Because of its industry-leading ease of use, FileMaker Pro has been powering web sites since before your webmaster was out of high school. FileMaker has had built-in web powers for almost 10 years, and FileMaker 8 is the most web-capable version yet.\nTable of Contents FileMaker Pro on the Web Instant Web Publishing Custom Web Publishing XML Publishing Setup and Configuration FileMaker Web Publishing Components Assembling the Pieces Performing the Installation Web Publishing Configuration Instant Web Publishing Using Instant Web Publishing with FileMaker Pro Using Instant Web Publishing with FileMaker Server Advanced Using Your Database in Instant Web Publishing Instant Web Publishing Tips Custom Web Publishing with PHP Installing the FileMaker API for PHP Setting up a Database for the PHP API Serving a PHP File Using the FileMaker API for PHP Learning More About the FileMaker API for PHP Custom Web Publishing with XSLT Enabling Custom Web Publishing with XSLT Understanding XML Preparing a Database for XSLT Publishing Writing an XSLT Template Building More Complex XSLT Web Applications The XSLT Site Assistant XML Publishing XML Publishing Commands Common URL Parameters Additional Parameters Conclusion FileMaker Pro on the Web As you plan your web database strategy, your first task is to decide which of FileMaker’s web options makes the most sense for you. It can be daunting at first, because any discussion of web technologies inevitably ends up tripping over its own acronyms. But FileMaker’s web technologies are, for the most part, actually quite distinct, and choosing the right one is usually easy once you know the strengths and weaknesses of each.\nFileMaker 8 supports four web publishing technologies: Instant Web Publishing, Custom Web Publishing with PHP, Custom Web Publishing with XSLT, and XML Publishing. Read on to find out how each one works.\nInstant Web Publishing The first option for putting your database on the web is Instant Web Publishing, often called simply IWP. As its name implies, this method makes web publishing exceptionally fast and easy: Click on a checkbox and your database is on the web.\nAs Figure 1 shows, when you turn on IWP, your users can see a browser-based version of your database that looks and acts an awful lot like the real thing. FileMaker takes care of all the Dynamic HTML, JavaScript, and server communications for you, producing near-perfect copies of your layouts on a web page.\nFigure 1The window in the back shows this database open in FileMaker Pro. In front, the same database is open in a web browser with Instant Web Publishing.\nAlso, unlike the other web technologies in FileMaker, IWP requires no special software. If your needs are modest (five or fewer simultaneous web users), you can IWP-enable your database right from your desktop computer with your stock copy of FileMaker Pro or FileMaker Pro Advanced. Of course if your needs grow beyond this five-user limit, you can upgrade to the industrial-strength FileMaker Server Advanced (and a dedicated server computer) which can handle 100 web users at the same time.\nIf you stopped reading here, you might wonder why anyone would ever use anything but IWP. After all, what more do you need than a no-programmer-necessary one-click method to automatically web-enable your database? It is true that IWP is often the most obvious choice, but it has some significant weaknesses that make it unsuitable in some cases.\nFirst, IWP takes on the heroic task of duplicating your FileMaker layout (buttons, body parts, backgrounds and all) on a web page. And it augments those pages with the web equivalent of the status area, from which you can switch layouts, alternate between list and form views, perform finds, and create new records. If you want a more stylized web interface (a traditional shopping car for instance, or a super-simplified page for searching your product catalog, or an employee directory that looks just like the rest of your web site), you’ll find IWP isn’t up to the task.\nIWP is also a wholly proprietary piece of technology. Since FileMaker takes care of all the web code for you, there’s no way for you to supplement that code to take advantage of other web technologies like PHP, XML, or web services. If you’re looking for that degree of flexibility, you’ll need to keep reading.\nIn practice, IWP is an ideal choice if your goal is to take the database you’ve already built, and make it accessible to people who don’t have FileMaker Pro, or to remote users with slower Internet connections.\nCustom Web Publishing If IWP lacks the flexibility you need, FileMaker offers a much more powerful web publishing option called Custom Web Publishing, or CWP.\nNote: Prior versions of FileMaker included a similar but unrelated web publishing technology called CDML. Custom Web Publishing has replaced CDML, which is no longer supported. CWP stands in stark contrast to IWP. Most importantly, it gives you as the developer complete control over the look and behavior of the web pages. But this flexibility comes with a price: Significantly more effort on your part. While IWP works “out of the box” with just one click, CWP generally requires that you write code to tell FileMaker how to create the required web pages. These web pages may incorporate data from the FileMaker Pro database, but they are completely independent of the look (Layouts) of your database. Of course you can also create web pages that change the data in your database by adding, deleting, and editing records.\nTo take advantage of CWP, you must purchase and install FileMaker Server Advanced on a dedicated server computer. This extended version of FileMaker Server has the power to talk to the web server software on the computer and to process the code that makes up your CWP site.\nCustom Web Publishing with XSLT Historically, the code behind CWP has been written in a web-standard language called XSLT (an abbreviation for Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations, whatever that means). You’ll get a primer on XSLT shortly, but it is worth pointing out that XSLT, while extremely powerful and well suited to certain tasks, is much more complicated than anything else in FileMaker. For this reason, many expert FileMaker developers have struggled to master its nuances. Never the less, CWP with XSLT is an excellent choice for web publishing if you are well versed in XML or XSLT, or have a programming background.\nBut you should not assume that web publishing is limited to producing pretty web pages. An entire field of web publishing centers around so-called web services, which are web sites designed to be used not by human beings, but by other computer programs. If you’ve used the Windows Update or Software Update feature of your operating system, you’ve seen web services in action: your computer automatically discovers when new software is available by visiting a web site custom crafted for it, behind the scenes and without bothering you about it until it needs your input. Web service data is not formatted for style or beauty; rather, it is designed to be concise, consistent, and often to comply with some agreed-upon standard. It turns out many of these standards are built around XML, and XSLT is particularly suited to producing XML output. If you want to publish your FileMaker data as an RSS feed, make it available to XML-based EDI clearinghouses, or serve up customized Microsoft Office 2007 documents full of data, XSLT is probably the best choice.\nCustom Web Publishing with PHP More recently, FileMaker has addressed the XSLT brain-freeze by opening CWP up to a much more common and straightforward language called PHP. This uber-popular web programming language is relatively easy to learn. And if you’re averse to coding of any kind, you can probably find a dozen expert PHP programmers in your neighborhood. Finally, PHP is tremendously flexible. It has built in capabilities that range from automated email to file processing, and what it doesn’t have built in can easily be added by downloading add-ons from thousands of sites on line. These attributes make PHP a fantastic choice when you want to publish your FileMaker data as custom web pages.\nXML Publishing The final web publishing technology in FileMaker is a bit of an enigma to most FileMaker developers. Like IWP, you can start using XML Publishing with the click of a button. But what you get is not the sort of thing you’d want to show your users. XML Publishing presents your FileMaker data in its most raw form: as a list of records in a specialized XML format accessible on the web. It provides simple commands to find, create, delete, and edit records via the web. This can be thought of as the least common denominator of data exchange: nearly every programming environment in the world, from Java to Visual Basic to Ruby, can read XML data and talk to a web page. And if your particular system can’t read XML, you can always have a programmer create a tool that reads FileMaker’s XML and converts it into just about any format that system could want. So XML Publishing exists to make a FileMaker database available to the larger software world, and is primarily the domain of programmers.\nAs an example of the power of XML Publishing, consider this: CWP is built on top of XML Publishing. Whether you use XSLT or PHP, when your code starts to interact with the FileMaker database, it does so by sending XML Publishing commands and processing XML data.\nSetup and Configuration If you intend to publish on the web with FileMaker Server Advanced, your first task is to install and configure the software. Remember that you must use FileMaker Server Advanced to use Custom Web Publishing (CWP) or XML Publishing, or to use Instant Web Publishing (IWP) with more than five users.\nNote: Even if you have five or fewer users, there are advantages to using FileMaker Server Advanced with IWP. First, IWP is faster and more responsive for the users when run on a server. Also, because FileMaker Server Advanced installs on a dedicated server machine, you don’t have to worry about disrupting other uses if you reboot your computer or if it crashes. Also note that on Windows, FileMaker Server Advanced requires Windows 2003 Server or Windows 2000 Server. You cannot install it on Windows XP or Vista. Mac users, on the other hand, can use any recent version of Mac OS X.\nFileMaker Web Publishing Components FileMaker Server Advanced is not just a single program, and it does not handle all aspects of web publishing. In fact, there are four separate components to a FileMaker web publishing system: The FileMaker Server, the Web Server, the Web Publishing Engine, and the Web Server Module.\nFileMaker Server In order to publish FileMaker data, you need a FileMaker database. FileMaker Server Advanced includes the same software as the standard FileMaker Server. This software manages the actual FileMaker database, ensuring that every connected user can access and modify the database as efficiently as possible. An installed FileMaker Server can share databases between connected FileMaker users and web publishing users at the same time.\nNote: The word server can be misleading because it has two different meanings in relation to computers. First of all, a server is a specialized computer designed to host databases, web sites, streaming video, and other content that multiple computers can access at the same time. But server also refers to the software programs that actually do the serving. You generally install server software on a server computer. Here, both Web Server and FileMaker Server refer to software you install on a server computer. Later you’ll learn about the hardware required. You may have more than one FileMaker Server, but each FileMaker database (or file) must exist on only one FileMaker Server.\nThe Web Publishing Engine The actual web side of FileMaker web publishing is the domain of the aptly named Web Publishing Engine. It processes the XML Publishing commands, converts FileMaker data to XML, and processes any XSLT stylesheets you may have created.\nA web publishing engine can access as many FileMaker databases as you want, and can publish data using IWP, CWP, and XML Publishing all at once.\nThe Web Server Although it is not a part of FileMaker Server Advanced, web server software is an essential component to a FileMaker web publishing setup. The web server is what actually talks to the web browser that your user connects with. It also talks to the Web Publishing Engine when it needs to access FileMaker content. FileMaker Server Advanced supports these web servers:\nThe web server component of Microsoft Internet Information Services, better known as IIS. As luck would have it, this is exactly the system that is built right in to Windows. The Apache web server on Mac OS X. Again, Apache is built right in. Normally, the web server is not a major concern since it is included with either supported operating system. But if you have replaced your web server for any reason, you may have difficulty. FileMaker supports only these two configurations. So, for instance, you cannot use Apache on Windows with FileMaker Server Advanced.\nThe Web Server Module The final piece in a FileMaker Server Advanced installation is the web server module. This small piece of software is essentially a plug-in for the web server software that allows it to communicate with the Web Publishing Engine. You rarely give this piece much thought, except to install it when you first set things up.\nAssembling the Pieces The FileMaker Server, Web Publishing Engine, and Web Server can be installed on separate computers or the same computer in any combination, so you have a lot of options. (The web server module is not mentioned in this discussion because it always installs along side the web server itself.)\nSimple Single-Computer Configuration The simplest and least expensive option is to install all three components on a single computer. This is simple for two reasons. First, installation is a breeze: the FileMaker Server Advanced installer program will put everything in the right place for you, assuming the appropriate web server software is already installed. Second, it is easy to manage because you have only one computer to sit down at or log in to when you need to make changes to your configuration, install XSLT or PHP pages, or add new FileMaker databases.\nBut the all-for-one approach is also the least efficient since you are asking one computer to do three jobs at once. This means each task has less memory and less CPU time to spend doing its work. But don’t let this frighten you away from this approach. For many installations, with few users, small databases, and a reasonable number of web connections, the single-machine setup can perform well. Exactly how much is too much is very dependent on what your database and web pages do, but in general if you have less than 20 users, a single server configuration should perform well.\nMultiple-Computer Configurations If you decide you need more than one server computer to support your web publishing, you then need to decide how many computers, and which software goes where. To help with the decision, here are the relative performance characteristics of each component.\nFileMaker Server demands fast hard disk access, can use a lot of CPU and has modest memory requirements. Web Publishing Engine does not require fast disk access; with XSLT and large data sets, can use a fair amount of CPU and lots of memory. Web Server likes a fast disk and a modest amount of memory, but uses very little CPU; When using PHP, your web publishing code runs on the web server, making it more CPU-intensive. For example, if you know you will be doing heavy-duty XSLT processing, it may not make sense to have the Web Publishing Engine and the FileMaker Server on the same machine: they can both be CPU-heavy. Also, the FileMaker Server computer needs a fast disk system, an expensive resource that is wasted on the Web Publishing Engine. On the other hand, if your web publishing is limited to XML or PHP, the Web Publishing Engine will see relatively little load, and may not interfere with FileMaker Server much.\nYou could elect to put each component on its own machine. As long as a fast network connects the three machines, this will give you maximum performance. Each component has dedicated hardware and plenty of breathing room. But this is also the most expensive configuration, and is often not necessary.\nA reasonable compromise is a two-computer configuration, with two components on one computer and the third on another. If you’re logically inclined, you’ve probably realized there are exactly three possibilities here:\nPut FileMaker Server and the Web Publishing Engine on one computer, and the web server on the second. You might choose this configuration if you already have a web server you intend to use and you want to publish FileMaker data through it with minimal impact on the web server itself. This model keeps all the FileMaker-specific software off the web server (with the exception of an inconsequential connector the web server uses to talk to the Web Publishing Engine).\nPut FileMaker Server on its own computer, and share the second between the Web Publishing Engine and the web server. This model is wise if your FileMaker Server is also handling a heavy load of standard FileMaker users. It allows you to add web publishing capabilities without installing additional software on the critical FileMaker Server computer.\nPut FileMaker Server and the web server on one computer and the Web Publishing Engine on the second. This is generally not a good configuration because the web server and FileMaker Server will contend for the same resources. If you have split FileMaker Server and the Web Publishing Engine onto separate machines, it makes sense to put the web server with the Web Publishing Engine.\nPerforming the Installation Like all things FileMaker, installing the parts of FileMaker Server Advanced starts with running a simple installer program. The entire installation process is explained in depth in the FileMaker Server 8 Advanced Web Publishing Installation Guide, which comes with FileMaker Server Advanced and is also available online at this address:\nhttp://www.filemaker.com/downloads/documentation/fmsa8_web_install.pdf\nYou really do yourself a favor by reviewing the information in this manual before you dive in and click Install. It covers important changes to your web server configuration you may need to make (Chapter 2) and has instructions for installing all components at once (Chapter 2), or performing a more complex multi-computer installation (Chapter 4).\nAt its heart, though, the three FileMaker-provided components in FileMaker Server Advanced are available as installation options, and your job is to go to each server computer and install the correct pieces. Also note that if you already have a FileMaker Server running, you only need to make a configuration change to get it connected to the Web Publishing Engine (this is explained below). There is no need to reinstall the FileMaker Server itself.\nWeb Publishing Configuration Once you have all the components installed and have performed the requisite reboots, you still need to configure your server(s) before you can get to work.\nNote: You might be thinking this process is very complex compared to installing FileMaker Pro itself, and you’re right. This is partly because FileMaker Server Advanced needs to fit in with various server configurations, and can’t make all the decisions for you during installation. But it is also important to remember that web published data is by definition open to a wide audience, so security is a paramount concern. Server software of all kinds generally requires configuration immediately after installation so you can establish necessary security settings (passwords and the like) before you begin to make your data available. First, you need to set up the Web Publishing Engine. Remember that this software handles the web side of FileMaker’s publishing powers: it processes you XML requests and XSLT stylesheets. It also performs all the magic of IWP, converting FileMaker layouts into web pages on the fly.\nuckily, FileMaker makes this configuration fairly easy: you do it by connecting to the web publishing engine with your web browser. FileMaker shows you the Administration Console, a web application in its own right that makes all the configuration options available by point-and-click. To access the administration console, you first need to know the URL that points to your web server. Then you just append some mysterious goo on the end of that URL. For example, if the web server you’ve configured for web publishing is at http://web.mycompany.com/, you would access the administration console at this address:\nhttp://web.mycompany.com/fmi/config\nBy accessing a URL with “/fmi/config” after the server name, you instruct the server to pull up the administration console.\nUnderstanding FileMaker URLs If you’re not a URL expert, this part can be confusing. A web URL (or web address) consists of a few key parts. It starts with “http://” or “https://” which just tells your browser you are requesting a regular web page.\nNext comes the name of the server computer where the web server software is installed. In this example, the server name is “web.mycompany.com” but you’ll need to get the correct name for your web server.\nSometimes you’ll need to add a port number after the server name. If your web server is listening on port number 8000, for instance, your URL would look like this: http://web.mycompany.com:8000/fmi/config. Notice that the port number is separated from the server name by a colon (:). You only need to list the port number in this way if it your web server is not using port 80, the standard port for the http, or 443, the standard port for https. If you’re not sure what server name or port number to use, try 80 or consult your system administrator.\nFinally, after the server name is something called the path component. In a typical URL, the path component refers to some file on the hard drive of the web server computer. But in the world of web applications and dynamic web content, the path rarely refers to a file. In this case, for example, you will not find a file at “/fmi/config” on your computer. Instead, the web server software uses this path to figure out how to handle your request. The first pat (“/fmi”) tells the web server to forward the request as-is to the FileMaker Web Publishing Engine (“fmi” stands for FileMaker Inc.). The Web Publishing Engine then further inspects the path, and sees the “/config” part, which tells it to serve up its administration console so you can configure it. You’ll see many other URLs with paths that start with “/fmi” as you read on. This is how the web server knows you want to talk to FileMaker rather than to any other files or servers it may be configured to work with.\nWhen you enter the correct address in your web browser, you should arrive at the page pictured in Figure 2.\nFigure 2You know you have the FileMaker Web Publishing components properly installed when you can reach the Administration Console. On your first visit to this page, you are asked to make some one-time settings.\nAs you progress through the administration console’s initial configuration, most of the information requested is obvious: You need to provide a username and password to secure access to the console itself, and to the Web Publishing Engine component. You also need to describe how you have configured your deployment, by either entering the address of the server computer where the Web Publishing Engine and FileMaker Server are installed, or by indicating that they’re on the same machine as the web server.\nThe only tricky part of the setup comes when the administration console asks you to enter your FileMaker Server Identifier and Passcode. Because of the public nature of many web publishing installations, it could be possible for someone you don’t know to install a Web Publishing Engine on their computer and configure it to interact with your FileMaker Server. To prevent this, you have to assign your FileMaker Server a private identifier and password (or passcode) that only you know. This information is required to get a Web Publishing Engine to talk to the server. So to complete the configuration process you need to visit the FileMaker Server Admin application that was installed on your FileMaker Server computer. To set an identifier and passcode, on Mac OS X click the Configure toolbar icon. On Windows, right-click on the server name on the left-hand side and choose Properties. In either case, you then switch to the Clients tab. Here you will see an empty list labeled FileMaker Web Publishing Engines. Click the Add button by this list and enter the identifier and passcode of your choice. You are now ready to return to the administration console and enter these same values.\nOnce the basic configuration is complete, the Web Publishing Engine is up and running, and all forms of FileMaker web publishing are turned on. If at any time you want to change the configuration (for instance, if you decide to move your FileMaker Server to a different computer) you can log back in to the administration console and make the required changes.\nWhile you’re here, you should also decide which services you will be using and turn off and you don’t need (you can always turn them back on later). First, click the grey Publishing Engine tab in the bar across the top of the page. You will see the information shown in Figure 3.\nFigure 3The Publishing Engine section in the administration console lets you control logging and, more importantly, which web publishing technologies are enabled.\nIn the second grey bar, below the primary tabs, you see a list of links. Each link takes you to a different section of settings for the Web Publishing Engine. For example, to change the settings for Instant Web publishing, click the Instant Web Publishing link next to General Settings. There, you can turn Instant Web Publishing off if you don’t intend to use it. As a general rule, you should disable any service you aren’t using to reduce the likelihood of a security problem and to reduce excess memory usage on the computer.\nInstant Web Publishing As you’ve already learned, Instant Web publishing is the fastest way to get your database on the web, and is often an excellent choice if your primary goal is to make an existing database (user interface and all) available to remote users or people who don’t have FileMaker Pro.\nYour first decision is whether to host your web database from your desktop machine using FileMaker Pro or FileMaker Pro Advanced, or to use a dedicated Web Publishing environment for better performance and more capacity. If your FileMaker database is already hosted on FileMaker Server, then the answer is made for you: you can’t use serverless (peer-to-peer) IWP sharing unless the database is local to your computer.\nUsing Instant Web Publishing with FileMaker Pro If you elect to share without a server, setup is a breeze. First, launch FileMaker Pro and open the database (or databases) you want to share. Next, on Windows, choose File-\u0026gt;Sharing-\u0026gt;Instant Web Publishing or on Mac OS X choose FileMaker Pro-\u0026gt;Sharing-\u0026gt;Instant Web Publishing. You see the dialog box in Figure 4.\nFigure 4The Instant Web Publishing dialog box (File → Sharing → Instant Web Publishing on Windows, FileMaker Pro → Sharing → Instant Web Publishing on Mac OS X) lets you turn on peer-to-peer instant web publishing and configure which databases can be accessed over the web.\nGetting your database on the web is a two-step process from here. First, turn on Instant Web Publishing by clicking the On radio button. This turns on the IWP system inside FileMaker Pro. But it does not share any databases.\nNext you need to tell FileMaker exactly which databases should be shared. From the “Currently open files” list, click your database. In the “Instant Web Publishing access to file” area to the right, you can tell FileMaker to make this database accessible from the web. You have three choices:\nNo users tells FileMaker this database should not be shared on the web. All users tells FileMaker to share this database and allow any user who has access to the file to connect to it. In other words, FileMaker will ask the web user to enter a username and password just the way it does when you open the database directly. If the person has a valid username and password, he or she will be granted access. Specify users by privilege set tells FileMaker you only want some users to be able to access the file over the web. You could, for example, create a new Privilege Set (in File → Define → Accounts and Privileges) for specific users and grant only those users web access. Note: Although you can configure IWP access for any open database in this window, you are actually making changes to the Privilege Sets in the database. If you prefer, you can go to File → Define → Accounts and Privileges and make the changes there. Just edit any Privilege Set and turn on “Access via Instant Web Publishing (fmiwp).” You’ll use this approach when you set up a database to be shared using FileMaker Server Advanced below. The Instant Web Publishing dialog box also shows you the URL you can use to access your shared database. Go to this URL in your web browser to see FileMaker’s IWP home page, which lists each accessible database. Click a database name to log in to it and you should see a good web-rendition of your database.\nThere are a lot of important tips to making your database work as well as possible with IWP, and they will all be covered shortly. But first, you’ll learn how to share a database using IWP with FileMaker Server Advanced.\nUsing Instant Web Publishing with FileMaker Server Advanced If you choose to share your database with FileMaker Server Advanced, you have a more involved set up process (which is more than worth it given the performance advantages). The first step is to prepare your database for IWP. You can do this when the file on your hard drive, or after it has been loaded on your FileMaker Server. Just open the database, and then choose File-\u0026gt;Define-\u0026gt;Accounts and Privileges. In the dialog box that appears, switch to the Extended Privileges tab. FileMaker decides which databases can be accessed via IWP and which users can log in based on an Extended Privilege called “Access via Instant Web Publishing. “ Find this Extended Privilege in the list, select it, and click Edit. This summons the Edit Extended Privilege dialog box, where you can decide which Privilege Sets have this Extended Privilege enabled. In other words, if you only want one particular set of users to have IWP access, assign them to a single privilege set (called, for example, IWP Access) and turn on only that privilege set here. If you want all valid users of your database to have IWP access, turn on every Privilege Set in this list.\nIf you haven’t already, copy the database to your FileMaker Server’s database folder, and, using FileMaker Server Admin, open the database on the server.\nNow you’re ready to set up IWP in the Web Publishing Engine. First, connect to the administration console for your Web Publishing Engine. You’ll need to use the same URL, username, and password you used when you first installed and configured FileMaker Server Advanced above. Log in to the administration console, click the grey Web Publishing Engine tab, and then the blue Instant Web Publishing link below the row of tabs. You will see the page shown in Figure 5.\nFigure 5Configuring IWP in FileMaker Server Advanced’s administration console is a lot like configuring it in FileMaker Pro. Just turn it on.\nIn this window, simply turn on Instant Web Publishing if it isn’t already. Again, FileMaker shows you the URL you should use to connect to the database in your web browser. This time, though, the URL points to the web server computer in your web publishing setup, and it includes the path “/fmi/iwp” to tell the web server you want Instant Web Publishing.\nUsing Your Database in Instant Web Publishing In the browser, your database looks a lot like it does in FileMaker Pro itself. But you’re sure to notice some striking differences. First of all, the menus in a web browser’s menu bar obviously don’t match FileMaker’s. To combat this problem, FileMaker puts the most common commands in the Status Area where they are easily accessible. Figure 6 shows the IWP Status Area with each part labeled.\nFigure 6The Status Area in IWP includes extra buttons to access common FileMaker commands that are normally available via the menus.\nOf note, the Status Area includes a Go Home button, which returns to the IWP welcome screen where you can select another database to open. It also allows you to perform basic operations, like adding a new record or deleting the current record. The Edit Record button switches the record to Edit Mode, a mode unique to IWP. Normally a record is view-only. When you switch to Edit Mode, you can modify field data. When you’re finished, you click Submit to save the changes or Cancel to revert the record (both buttons appear in the Status Area in Edit Mode). You can also enter Edit Mode simply by clicking on any field that is normally enterable in Browse Mode.\nLike the normal FileMaker Status Area, the IWP version includes a pop-up menu from which you can choose a layout to view. But in addition to this, the View pop-up menu lets you decide to view a layout in List view, Form view, or Table view (much like the View menu in FileMaker Pro). When you switch to List View (or switch to a layout that is set to show in List View), the behavior of the list is slightly unfamiliar. In the IWP list view, the current record is always at the top of the window. A few additional records show below this one just like a list. To view more records, either above or below what is showing, use the book icon to flip backward or forward. As you do, you will see a different set of records in the list. Table View works similarly.\nNote: If you don’t want users to switch views on a layout, simply turn that view off for the layout. In FileMaker Pro, switch to Layout Mode. Then choose Layouts → Layout Setup and switch to the Views tab in the resulting dialog box. Here you can turn on or off the checkboxes to control which views are allowed for this layout. As with most things in FileMaker, settings in the desktop version translate seamlessly to IWP. Aside for these minor distinctions, the IWP database works very much like you would expect. As long as you follow some guidelines to ensure good IWP compatibility (see below) your database is very usable for anybody with a web browser.\nInstant Web Publishing Tips Although IWP is a one-click affair, there are things you need to keep in mind if you want to ensure the best experience possible for your users. In fact, if your database is complex, chances are you will have to make some changes or restrict what actions web users can do to ensure proper functioning. Problems fall into three primary areas: user interface, missing features, and scripting compatibility.\nUser Interface Compatibility Issues It’s a tough prospect, turning a FileMaker layout into a web page. For starters, every web browser is a little bit different, with its own restrictions on what can be controlled look-wise. Not to mention the language of web pages is decidedly … boxy. It turns out there are some things FileMaker simply can’t translate exactly. The most important are:\nRound things are out. If your layout uses rounded-corner rectangles or rounded buttons, FileMaker draws them with sharp corners instead. This is usually not a very big deal, but it does change the way your layout looks slightly. More damaging, ovals and circles are ignored completely and simply don’t show up on the page. Luckily, if you paste images on your layout (those that you created in a different program) they display just fine, so if you absolutely must have a circle around your logo, draw the circle in PaintBrush, Pages, PhotoShop, or some other program, then copy it and paste it onto the layout.\nFor similar reasons, diagonal lines are also not supported. Again, use another program to draw what you want, then paste it onto the layout.\nImages with transparent portions will not translate well to the web unless the original was a GIF image. Use the Insert-\u0026gt;Picture command in Layout Mode to put a transparent GIF on the layout and the transparency will show on the web. Otherwise, transparent portions will show incorrectly (black or white).\nSometimes fonts render differently on the web page. You may need to make the text objects on your layout slightly larger if the text incorrectly wraps to multiple lines.\nIn addition to these specific guidelines, bear in mind that tolerances on the web aren’t quite as pixel-perfect as FileMaker’s layout system. For best results you may need to make your layouts a little roomier. For example, scroll bars on portals are bigger on the web page than in FileMaker, so if things are tight, something may be cut off.\nMissing Features in Instant Web Publishing Many of FileMaker’s more advanced features simply aren’t available in IWP. If you need to do any of these things, your user will have to have a full copy of FileMaker Pro. The major missing features are:\nImport and Export records Insert pictures, movies, sounds, and files in container fields Use preview mode and print Spell check Note: Your users are free to print the web page they see in the browser. It will print like any other web page. But if you have custom reports that are nicely formatted to print on a page and/or use Sub-Summary parts, they won’t display or print properly through the web. It should go without saying, but you can’t create new database, modify the database structure, or modify layouts or scripts.\nScripting Compatibility Issues Due to the missing features and the limitations of a web browser, many of the standard steps in ScriptMaker are not supported in IWP. Luckily, FileMaker makes it easy to tell which script steps are not supported. When in ScriptMaker, turn on the “Indicate web compatibility” check box. When this option is turned on, any script step that is not compatible with IWP will turn grey.\nAny step that is not web compatible will not execute in IWP, but the script itself will continue unabated. Because of this, scripts can behave in unexpected ways if you’re not careful to check for incompatible steps. It also means it is acceptable to have incompatible steps in a script if you are certain it will still work correctly if the incompatible steps are skipped.\nIf necessary, a script can check to see if it is running under IWP while it executes using the Get(ApplicationVersion) function. The result of this function will include the word “Web” if the user is accessing the database via IWP. For example, you can do this in a script:\nIf [PatternCount(Get(ApplicationVersion), “Web”) \u0026gt; 0] … do something only when run via IWP … End If The script steps inside the If condition will only execute when the script is run through IWP. Of course by changing the condition to PatternCount(Get(ApplicationVersion), “Web”) = 0 you can add steps to a script that will not run under IWP.\nFinally, if you have entire scripts that should never be accessed from the web, you can use a custom web-only Privilege Set that does not allow these scripts to be run. You can also block IWP access to layouts that should not be accessed in the same way.\nCustom Web Publishing with PHP Despite its tremendous ease-of-use, IWP has one significant limitation: it doesn’t work like a normal web site. This is just what you want if you’re hoping to mimic your FileMaker database for web users, but often you really want to build a branded web site with some database-backed functionality. In a case like that, you need Custom Web Publishing instead. With CWP, you can make the web pages look exactly the way you want, and still incorporate data from your database. You can even build custom forms that add or edit records in the database when submitted, and run scripts in FileMaker where necessary.\nInstalling the FileMaker API for PHP If you’re new to web development (and even if you’re not) PHP is often the best choice for custom web publishing because it is easier to understand and work with than XSLT. Unfortunately, getting PHP up-and-running requires a little more work because the PHP capabilities are not built in to the Web Publishing Engine. Outfitting your FileMaker Web Publishing system with PHP capabilities requires that you download and install an additional component on your web server computer: the FileMaker API for PHP. You can download the installer from this location:\nhttp://www.filemaker.com/developers/resources/php/\nAfter filling out a quick form, FileMaker will email you the download link. On the download page, you are given two download options. Usually you should choose the “If you are new to PHP” version, which will install PHP, install the FileMaker add-ons for PHP, and configure your server all in one shot. If you are a PHP expert, already have a compatible version of PHP on your server, and just want the FileMaker-specific PHP code, choose the “If you are currently using PHP” download instead. (If you chose the latter option, be sure you review the Read Me file that comes with the download to ensure you have an appropriate version of PHP, and for important information on using the API.)\nThe PHP API communicates with FileMaker using the XML Publishing functionality in the Web Publishing Engine. So the next step is to enable this feature. Again, log in to the administration console and click to the Web Publishing Engine tab. This time, click the XML Publishing link and make sure XML Publishing is turned on.\nA Brief Introduction to PHP This whitepaper won’t give you a full understanding of PHP, but it will help you make sense of the examples if you understand just a few PHP basics. PHP is essentially a scripting language particularly suited to producing text output. In other words, it has a full suite of programming capabilities (looping and conditional capabilities, variables, and so forth). At the same time, unlike more typical scripting languages, PHP makes it seamless and easy to output text. For example, this is a perfectly valid PHP script:\nHello World If you run this script in PHP, it will simply output the text “Hello World.” Any text in the script becomes output automatically unless you take care to put it inside special tags. Consider this example:\nHello World, it is now \u0026lt;?php echo date(\u0026#34;d-M-Y h:i:s\u0026#34;) ?\u0026gt; When this PHP script is run, the text “Hello World, it is now “ is sent directly to the web page. But the \u0026lt;?php and ?\u0026gt; tags tell the PHP processor that you want it to execute some script code between them. In this case, you’re asking PHP to echo (or output) the current date and time. The result of this script might be:\nHello World, it is now 20-Feb-2007 10:32:47 By mixing ordinary text and code like this, you can very easily produce valid HTML output with dynamic content. In the above example, the current date is dynamically inserted into the output, but using the FileMaker API for PHP, you can grab data from the database and dynamically insert it into the output as well.\nNote: The remainder of this section will focus on using the FileMaker API. But PHP has an enormous amount of built-in functionality that shouldn’t be ignored. If you are serious about using PHP to build a web site, you should visit http://www.php.net/ or buy a good book on PHP to bring yourself up to speed. Setting up a Database for the PHP API FileMaker’s PHP API is essentially a series of PHP classes that enable PHP to talk to FileMaker (using the XML Publishing system). A class in PHP is simply a bundle of pre-written code you can easily use in your own PHP files. FileMaker has done all the hard work of formulating requests and processing XML, and given you a nice PHP-friendly set of commands to use.\nFor the purposes of illustration, you will now build a very simple PHP web page that displays a list of records in a database. First you need to create the database. Using FileMaker Pro or FileMaker Advanced, create a simple one-table database called Bookmarks. The database should have one table, also called Bookmarks, and the following fields:\nA Text field called Name A Text field called URL A Text field called Description This database will hold links to web pages you find interesting. To make testing easier, go ahead and add a few records to the database.\nBefore you can access this database with PHP, you need to set up security. Go to Define → Accounts and Privileges, then switch to the Privilege Sets tab. Click New to create a new Privilege Set. This privilege set will govern what the PHP code can do with your database. Name this Privilege Set PHP Access. Under Data Access and Design, make the following selections:\nFor Records, choose “View only in all tables” For Layouts, choose “All view only” For Value Lists, choose “All view only” For Scripts, choose “All no access” These settings allow PHP scripts to use but not modify data in the database, and prevent them from running any scripts. This is a reasonable first stab at PHP security. If you later decide you need additional power, you can always revisit this screen and enable additional powers.\nNote: Since many web pages are open to the world, security is very important. If you publish your database on the web using the settings above, and your Web Publishing Engine is not secured behind a firewall, then anybody in the world can view any data in your database by accessing the XML Publishing system directly. Your web-accessible privilege sets should always allow only the access that is needed and nothing more. In a PHP setup, it is also a good idea to restrict access to the Web Publishing Engine itself to just the Web Server. Then users can access the PHP site but not the databases directly. Click OK to dismiss the Define Privilege Set dialog box, but don’t OK the Define Accounts \u0026amp; Privileges window yet. The PHP API looks for a special extended privilege (fmphp) before it is willing to talk to a database. You need to add this extended privilege to your database and assign it to the new Privilege Set. First, switch to the Extended Privileges tab, then click New. The Edit Extended Privilege window appears. In the Keyword box, enter “fmphp” (without the quotes). In the Description box, enter “Access via FileMaker API for PHP” (or anything you want; the description is strictly informational). Finally, in the Access list, turn on the checkbox next to the PHP Access privilege set.\nSince PHP uses XML Publishing to talk to FileMaker, you also need to enable the Access via XML Web Publishing extended privilege set. When you’ve made these changes, click OK.\nFinally, you need to add an account to this database. The PHP API connects to the database using an account name and password, and the account must be assigned to this new PHP Access privilege set. Switch to the Accounts tab and click the New button. Make sure “Account is authenticated via” is set to FileMaker. In the Account Name box, you should enter a simple account name you’ll remember. For this example, enter php. This account also needs a secure password. Bear in mind that anybody who knows this username and password, and has access to your Web Publishing Engine and/or FileMaker Server can access your database. Choose a password that can’t be guessed but is easy to type and uses only letters, numbers, and the underscore character. Finally, in the Privilege Set pop-up menu, choose PHP Access. Click OK to save this account. Then click OK again in the Define Accounts \u0026amp; Privileges dialog box to close it as well.\nYou can now move your database to the FileMaker Server’s databases folder and open it using FileMaker Server Admin.\nServing a PHP File Now that you have a database with PHP API access, you’re ready to create a PHP page. Using any plain text editor, create a new file and type this text into it:\n\u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;My PHP Bookmarks Page\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Bookmarks\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; Save this file with the name “bookmarks.php” in a convenient location on your computer. Make sure you use the “.php” file extension so your web server knows to treat this as a PHP script. This script has no real code yet — you’ll be adding some shortly.\nNote: If you’re using Mac OS X and the TextEdit program, you need to put it into plain text mode before you save the file. With the file still open, choose Format → Make Plain Text. Then save the file. If you don’t do this step, your PHP file will nor work properly. In order to test the PHP file, it needs to be in a folder that is accessible by your web server. On Mac OS X, this is in /Library/WebServer/Documents. On Windows, it is usually in C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot, although you may have your web server configured to use a different disk or location. If you don’t find the wwwroot folder, try searching for it. In either case, the folder is called your web server root, and you will be copying files there a lot during this section, starting right now. Copy the bookmarks.php file to your web server root.\nTo be sure everything is placed properly, try accessing this web page. You’ll need to formulate a URL to access this page. The form will be something like this:\nhttp://yourserver/bookmarks.php\nBut instead of yourserver, you should enter the name or IP address of your web server computer. If everything is correct, you should see a page like the one in Figure 7.\nFigure 7It’s not much to look at yet, but if you see this, you know you’ve got PHP installed, you put the file in the right place, and you typed the file’s contents properly. If you don’t see this, read on.\nIf you don’t see a web page similar to the one in Figure 7, you have some sleuthing to do:\nIf your browser tells you it can’t find the server, then the server name portion of your URL is incorrect. Double check that you typed it properly and make sure you’re using the correct server name or IP address.\nIf your browsers says the page bookmarks,php doesn’t exist, you may have put the file in the wrong place. Double check that you copied the file directly into the web server root folder. Also, make sure you don’t have more than one web server installed on your computer and that you haven’t re-configured your web server to use a different root folder.\nIf, instead of the word Bookmarks, you see the actual HTML source code from the bookmarks.php file, then PHP is not installed properly on your computer. If you opted for the “I’m already using PHP” installer when you downloaded the FileMaker API for PHP, go back and install the other one instead.\nIf you see a blank page, you may have a typo in your source code. Make sure the bookmarks.php file you created has exactly the code shown above in it. Also, make sure you are using a program that can create plain text files. If you’re not sure, use NotePad on windows. On Mac OS X, use TextEdit and don’t forget to choose Format → Make Plain Text.\nTip: If you’re going to be writing a lot of PHP, you’ll do yourself a favor by buying a good programmer’s text editor program. Almost every programming-oriented text editor will recognize and help with PHP code automatically. On Windows, TextPad is an excellent choice. On Mac OS X, consider using TextMate or BBEdit. Using the FileMaker API for PHP Now that you have PHP being served correctly in your web publishing environment, it is time to add some dynamic content to your page. This page is simply going to list all the bookmark records in the database. For each record, the web page should include the name and description. Additionally, the name should be a link to the actual web page. There are at least 283 ways to do this in HTML, but the method this page will use is to add the records to an HTML dictionary list tag (dl). The tag will come before the first record and the tag will be added after the last one. Each record will be represented by this HTML:\n\u0026lt;dt\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=”[URL]”\u0026gt;[NAME]\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/dt\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dd\u0026gt;[DESCRIPTION]\u0026lt;/dd\u0026gt; Your mission is to get the PHP code to find all the Bookmark records, and output this HTML snippet for each one.\nFirst, you need to connect to the FileMaker database and perform a Find All. The complete code to do this, which should go at the top of your PHP file, is this:\n\u0026lt;?php require_once(\u0026#39;FileMaker.php\u0026#39;); $connection =\u0026amp; new FileMaker(\u0026#34;Bookmarks\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;servername\u0026#34;); $connection-\u0026gt;setProperty(\u0026#39;username\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;php\u0026#39;); $connection-\u0026gt;setProperty(\u0026#39;password\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;password\u0026#39;); $findAllCmd =\u0026amp; $connection-\u0026gt;newFindAllCommand(\u0026#39;Bookmakrs\u0026#39;); $result = $findAllCmd-\u0026gt;execute(); if (FileMaker::isError($result)) { echo \u0026#34;unable to execute Find All command: \u0026#34; . $result-\u0026gt;message; die(); } ?\u0026gt; There are a lot of steps there, so it will help to break it down into pieces. First of all any time you use the FileMaker API in a PHP file, you need to include this line:\nrequire_once(\u0026#39;FileMaker.php\u0026#39;); It tells PHP to load the API classes. Next, you need to tell the PHP API how to connect to your database:\n$connection =\u0026amp; new FileMaker(\u0026#34;Bookmarks\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;servername\u0026#34;); $connection-\u0026gt;setProperty(\u0026#39;username\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;php\u0026#39;); $connection-\u0026gt;setProperty(\u0026#39;password\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;password\u0026#39;); In your case, you should put your real server name or IP address in place of “servername” on the first line.\nNote: This time you want the name or address of your Web Publishing Engine server. If you have multiple computers in your web publishing system, make sure you choose the right address.\nOn the other hand, if you have both the Web Publishing Engine and the Web Server on one computer, you can use the shorthand localhost for the server name. Localhost is computer-speak for “this same computer.”\nYou should also substitute the password you gave your php user on the third line.\nThese three lines of code establish the connection information the API needs to talk to FileMaker. No connection has been made yet though. The API only connects when you execute a command. In this case, you want a Find All command, so use this code:\n$findAllCmd =\u0026amp; $connection-\u0026gt;newFindAllCommand(\u0026#39;Bookmarks\u0026#39;); This line creates a command object that knows how to find all records. In this case, the word “Bookmarks” being passed as a parameter to newFindAllCommand() is the name of the Layout you want the command to work with. All PHP interaction is done through a FileMaker layout. This layout determines what table is accessed, which table occurrence is used on the Relationship graph, and what fields are available. In this case, you’re using the layout FileMaker created for you when you created the database.\nFinally, you can execute the command with this code:\n$result = $findAllCmd-\u0026gt;execute(); Once this code runs, the $result variable will hold a list of records in the database, assuming there was no error. To check for an error, you use code like this:\nif (FileMaker::isError($result)) { echo \u0026#34;unable to execute Find All command: \u0026#34; . $result-\u0026gt;message; die(); } This code checks the result variable to see if an error occurred. If so, it writes an error message to the web page, then uses PHP’s die command , which is similar to FileMaker’s Halt Script script step. If there was no error, the script will continue normally.\nAgain, all the code so far should go at the top of the PHP file. It makes sense to connect to the database and grab the data you will need up-front. Once you have done this, and are sure you didn’t run into an error, you can start outputting HTML code. You’re going to put your record information after this line in your PHP file:\n\u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;Bookmarks\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; Your script then needs to loop through all the found records and spit out the HTML code as it goes. Remember that the variable called $result contains all the records. That variable is defined all throughout the PHP file, so you can use it right here:\n\u0026lt;?php $records = $result-\u0026gt;getRecords(); foreach($records as $key =\u0026gt; $record) { // anything here will repeat for // every record } ?\u0026gt; This snippet of code fetches the actual record data from the $result variable, then uses the PHP foreach command to loop through them. Any code you put between the { and } will repeat once for every record in the database. You can complete this loop like this:\n\u0026lt;?php $records = $result-\u0026gt;getRecords(); foreach($records as $key =\u0026gt; $record) { ?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dt\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;?php echo $record-\u0026gt;getField(\u0026#39;URL\u0026#39;) ?\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;?php echo $record-\u0026gt;getField(\u0026#39;Name\u0026#39;) ?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dt\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dd\u0026gt; \u0026lt;?php echo $record-\u0026gt;getField(\u0026#39;Description\u0026#39;) ?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dd\u0026gt; \u0026lt;?php }\t?\u0026gt; This enhanced version outputs the correct html for a single record. Since it is inside the foreach loop, it will do this for every record. This code should be put between and tags on the page. The complete page is shown here:\n\u0026lt;?php require_once(\u0026#39;FileMaker.php\u0026#39;); $connection =\u0026amp; new FileMaker(\u0026#34;Bookmarks\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;servername\u0026#34;); $connection-\u0026gt;setProperty(\u0026#39;username\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;php\u0026#39;); $connection-\u0026gt;setProperty(\u0026#39;password\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;password\u0026#39;); $findAllCmd =\u0026amp; $connection-\u0026gt;newFindAllCommand(\u0026#39;Bookmakrs\u0026#39;); $result = $findAllCmd-\u0026gt;execute(); if (FileMaker::isError($result)) { echo \u0026#34;unable to execute Find All command: \u0026#34; . $result-\u0026gt;message; die(); } ?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;My PHP Bookmarks Page\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Bookmarks\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;?php $records = $result-\u0026gt;getRecords(); foreach($records as $key =\u0026gt; $record) { ?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dt\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;?php echo $record-\u0026gt;getField(\u0026#39;URL\u0026#39;) ?\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;?php echo $record-\u0026gt;getField(\u0026#39;Name\u0026#39;) ?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dt\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dd\u0026gt; \u0026lt;?php echo $record-\u0026gt;getField(\u0026#39;Description\u0026#39;) ?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dd\u0026gt; \u0026lt;?php }\t?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; If you copy this revised file to your web server root folder, cross your fingers, and load the page in your web browser again, you should see something like Figure 8.\nFigure 8With the PHP code in place, the web page now shows data from the database. If you add records or modify fields, then refresh the page, you’ll see the changes reflect immediately.\nLearning More About the FileMaker API for PHP This sample file has only scratched the surface. With the PHP API, your PHP page can add new records to the database, edit existing records, delete records, display pictures or download files from container fields, execute scripts, and use value lists. When you install the PHP API, the installer also places complete documentation and sample files on your hard drive. On Windows, the documentation is here:\nC:\\Program Files\\FileMaker\\FileMaker Server\\Web Publishing\\FileMaker API for PHP Docs On Mac OS X, it can be found here:\n/Library/FileMaker Server/Web Publishing/FileMaker API for PHP Docs/ If you are new to web development, you will also benefit by reading up on HTML.\nCustom Web Publishing with XSLT If you are building a web service that uses XML, or you are familiar with XSLT, you may decide to use CWP with XSLT instead of PHP. XSLT is not as easy for beginners as PHP, and is not as broad in its capability or support base. But it is an excellent language for producing XML output, and can be very powerful. In this example, you will use XSLT to make a simple database accessible as an RSS feed — an open XML-based standard for delivering information.\nEnabling Custom Web Publishing with XSLT Because CWP with XSLT is built right in to the Web Publishing Engine, you don’t have any additional installation to do. You only need to be sure XSLT publishing is enabled in your Web Publishing Engine. By now, you could do this in your sleep, but it turns out this time you’ll find some options you haven’t seen before. First, connect to the Web Publishing Engine administration console (you used this page when you first installed the Web Publishing Engine). Switch to the Publishing Engine tab and click the XSLT Publishing link near the top of the page.\nIn addition to an On/Off switch (you should turn it On), this page gives you a few more options. First, you can put the XSLT system in Development mode or Production mode. In case it isn’t obvious, you should use Development mode while you are still developing. This ensures that when you make changes to the XSLT templates, the server notices right away so you can simply refresh in your web browser or other client program. When you switch to Production mode, FileMaker will load the XSLT templates only once to ensure maximum performance. For now, use Development mode.\nNext, you have the option of enabling or disabling “database sessions.” This is an advanced setting that can be hard to understand at first. Essentially, when your XSLT templates are processed, they access the FileMaker database like a mini copy of FileMaker Pro. If database sessions are turned off, each new page that is loaded by a particular user will run in a new and separate environment. This is the least-resource-intensive option, so it reduces load on your FileMaker server. But it also means that scripts that use global variables, global fields, and other database state may not work properly. If you intend to set a global value on one page and access it on another, you need to turn on database sessions. Otherwise, you should leave it off. For now, leave this option off.\nFileMaker’s XSLT system has the ability to send email messages. If you want to use this feature, you must provide correct information in the SMTP area of this page. This information tells the Web Publishing Engine how to talk to your mail server. For now, leave everything as it is.\nFinally, the Default Text Encoding options should be left alone for now. These advanced settings should only be changed if you know what you’re doing and have reason to change them.\nOnce you have made the appropriate changes, click Commit.\nUnderstanding XML XML is everywhere these days, and it can be hard to separate the many uses from the core of XML itself. XML, at its heart, is simply a structured way of representing complex information with plain text. It has a few simple rules (and a few not-so-simple rules that won’t be covered here). First, XML uses tags (much like HTML). In XML these are called entities, and they live between \u0026lt; and /\u0026gt;. For example, this is a simple XML entity:\n\u0026lt;message/\u0026gt; That XML entity doesn’t say much. It only represents the existence of a message, but you don’t know anything about that message. XML entities can have attributes, which tell you information about the entity. For example:\n\u0026lt;message type=\u0026#34;greeting\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; This time the message entity includes one attribute, the “type” attribute. An attribute always has a value, and the value in this case is “greeting.” Intuitively, you could assume that this entity represents a message that is suitable for greeting someone. An entity can have as many attributes as you want, or no attributes at all. An attribute, though, always has exactly one value.\nNote: It is also worth mentioning that entity and attribute names are case sensitive. \u0026lt;person/\u0026gt; is not the same as \u0026lt;Person/\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;person name=\u0026quot;Bill Gates\u0026quot;/\u0026gt; is different from \u0026lt;person Name=\u0026quot;Bill Gates\u0026quot;/\u0026gt;. When you’re working with XML and XSLT, you always need to be careful about case. XML entities can also have content. To wit:\n\u0026lt;message type=\u0026#34;greeting\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Hello World\u0026lt;/message\u0026gt; Notice that the message entity has seemingly been split in two. Instead of appearing once with /\u0026gt; on the end, it now appears twice. The first \u0026lt;message…\u0026gt; is the starting tag and begins the message entity. Later, the \u0026lt;/message\u0026gt; tag ends the entity (you can tell it is an ending tag because it has “/” before its name). Everything between these two tags is the content of the entity. Again, logically, this XML seems to represent a greeting-type message, and the message, apparently, says “Hello World.”\nThe content of an entity is not limited to just text. The XML in question could look like this as well:\n\u0026lt;message type=\u0026#34;greeting\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;recipient name=\u0026#34;reader\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; Hello World \u0026lt;/message\u0026gt; Now the XML message seems to be intended for the reader, because it has a recipient entity inside it, and that recipient entity names the reader. You can freely mix text and other entities in the content of an entity. In practice, though, most xml entities have either text or other entities, but not both, in their content. Some people, then, might prefer this sort of XML:\n\u0026lt;message type=\u0026#34;greeting\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;recipient name=\u0026#34;reader\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;text\u0026gt;Hello World\u0026lt;/text\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/message\u0026gt; This time the message entity contains no text of its own. Instead it contains two other entities. One of which (recipient) has no content at all. The other (text) does have content. Now suppose you wanted to put more than one message in your XML file. You might be tempted to do this:\n\u0026lt;message type=\u0026#34;greeting\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;recipient name=\u0026#34;reader\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;text\u0026gt;Hello World\u0026lt;/text\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/message\u0026gt; \u0026lt;message type=\u0026#34;farewell\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;recipient name=\u0026#34;lunar body\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;text\u0026gt;Goodnight, Moon\u0026lt;/text\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/message\u0026gt; As is so often the case, though, temptation has led you astray. Another of XML’s simple rules is this: everything in an XML document must be inside one big entity. The sample above has two message entities inside absolutely nothing. A corrected version appears here:\n\u0026lt;messages\u0026gt; \u0026lt;message type=\u0026#34;greeting\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;recipient name=\u0026#34;reader\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;text\u0026gt;Hello World\u0026lt;/text\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/message\u0026gt; \u0026lt;message type=\u0026#34;farewell\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;recipient name=\u0026#34;lunar body\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;text\u0026gt;Goodnight, Moon\u0026lt;/text\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/message\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/messages\u0026gt; This time, the two messages have been wrapped up in a new entity called, aptly, messages (note the plural). The sole purpose of this new entity is to stand in as the single root entity in this XML document so it follows the rules.\nThis approach demonstrates one more fact: XML entities can be nested as deeply as you want. You can have entities inside entities inside entities to your heart’s content. This fact leads to an important conclusion: XML data can be thought of as a tree. Not, per se, the kind that grows in a park. Rather, the kind Computer Scientists think about: A group of nodes and branches. Figure 9 shows this sample XML file when visualized as a tree.\nFigure 9In this tree-like representation of the XML file, each circle and rectangle is a node and the lines are branches. Every XML file can be thought of like this, if you’re so inclined.\nAs abstract as all this tree-talk seems, it will help you understand how XSLT works later on.\nAside from some esoteric cases, that is all there is to XML. If you think it through, you’ll realize that even with this enforced structure, XML can represent just about any kind of information — from family relationships to purchase orders to complex schematics. XML is also fairly easy for a human like you to read and understand, since it uses plain English names that are repeated as often as they’re needed. Finally, because of the rules, XML is also easy for a computer to process. It is this winning combination of simplicity, flexibility, human readability, and machine process-ability that has made XML so popular. It is an excellent general-purpose method of recording information in a file when you want to be sure other computer systems will be able to use the information.\nTo make interaction even easier, hundreds (probably thousands) of XML-based standards exist today. An XML-based standard is just an agreed-upon set of entities and attributes, all designed to meet a particular need. The message data in the sample above is not part of any standard, which is perfectly OK, But if you want to ensure consistency among multiple people and programs, standards can help. Usually these standards are defined formally and owned (or at least managed) by some organization. The definition of the standard lives at a web page somewhere, and an XML file that uses the standard refers to it formally. If the message XML in this example were a formal standard owned by FileMaker Inc. (it isn’t) then the file might look like this:\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE messages PUBLIC \u0026#34;-//FMI//DTD messages//EN\u0026#34; \u0026#34;/fmi/xml/messages.dtd\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;messages xmlns=\u0026#34;http://www.filemaker.com/xml/messages\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;message type=\u0026#34;greeting\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;recipient name=\u0026#34;reader\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;text\u0026gt;Hello World\u0026lt;/text\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/message\u0026gt; \u0026lt;message type=\u0026#34;farewell\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;recipient name=\u0026#34;lunar body\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;text\u0026gt;Goodnight, Moon\u0026lt;/text\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/message\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/messages\u0026gt; The new line added to the top is called a doctype and it declares this file to be of a certain type (in this case a type called messages). Also notice that the messages entity has a new attribute, called xmlns. Because different XML standards are owned by different people, and they all need to intermix safely, every entity name in every XML format in the world has to be unique. In other words, if Microsoft uses an entity called person in one of its standards, then Adobe would not be able to use person itself later. This is obviously not a very workable scenario, so XML supports the concept of namespaces. Each new standard can declare a new namespace with a unique name. Then it can put all its entities into that namespace. Now, nobody can use the same entity name within the same namespace, but anybody is free to use it in a different namespace instead.\nThe xmlns attribute on an entity declares the namespace it uses, along with all the entities inside it. Conceptually, you could pretend that the real name of the messages entity is “http://www.filemaker.com/xml/messages:messages” — the namespace, then a colon (:) and then the name of the entity. Likewise, the recipient entity in this document is not just a recipient, it is a “http://www.filemaker.com/xml/messages:recipient”. Luckily, you can declare the namespace just once, and use the short name for every entity throughout the file, to save reading all those long namespace values.\nIt is possible to have more than one XML standard at work at the same time in a single file. When that happens, you have more than one namespace referenced as well. Because it would be possible for two different entities to have the same name, XML uses a namespace prefix when mixing types. For example:\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE messages PUBLIC \u0026#34;-//FMI//DTD messages//EN\u0026#34; \u0026#34;/fmi/xml/messages.dtd\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;msg:messages xmlns:msg=\u0026#34;http://www.filemaker.com/xml/messages\u0026#34; xmlns:new=\u0026#34;http://someoneelse.com/xml/newtype\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;msg:message type=\u0026#34;greeting\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;msg:recipient name=\u0026#34;reader\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;msg:text\u0026gt;Hello World\u0026lt;/msg:text\u0026gt; \u0026lt;new:importance\u0026gt;not very\u0026lt;/new:importance\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/msg:message\u0026gt; \u0026lt;msg:message type=\u0026#34;farewell\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;msg:recipient name=\u0026#34;lunar body\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;msg:text\u0026gt;Goodnight, Moon\u0026lt;/msg:text\u0026gt; \u0026lt;new:importance\u0026gt;not at all\u0026lt;/new:importance\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/msg:message\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/msg:messages\u0026gt; This last iteration of the made up XML file includes entities from two different standards. First, it uses the imaginary FileMaker messages format. But it also uses another standard called newtype. The messages standard is defined to use the msg prefix (because the attribute name is xmlns:msg), while the newtype standard uses the new prefix. Every entity throughout the file also includes the appropriate prefix so the reader can tell which standard that particular entity comes from.\nShortly, you’ll learn about two XML standards: RSS, which is a popular way of making news, articles, podcasts, and other so-called syndicated content available to the world. And fmresultset, FileMaker Pro’s own XML standard for representing information about your database and the data in it. But first, you need to learn a little XSLT.\nPreparing a Database for XSLT Publishing Just as with IWP and PHP, you need to configure your database to work with XSLT Publishing. The process is nearly identical. For this example, first create a simple database called Press Releases with one table (also called Press Releases) and the following fields:\nA Date field called Release Date A Text field called Title A Text field called Content This database will hold press releases about your company. For the sake of testing, add a few records with sample data now.\nTo configure this database for XSLT Publishing, go to File-\u0026gt;Define-\u0026gt;Accounts and Privileges. Click the Privilege Sets tab. Create a new Privilege Set called XSLT Access. Just as you did with the PHP Access privilege set (page XX), grant this Privilege Set view only access to records, value lists, and layouts, and no access to scripts. While the Edit Privilege Set window, turn on “Access via XSLT Web Publishing” in the Extended Privileges list. Click OK when you are finished.\nNow switch to the Accounts tab and turn on the Guest account. Also, edit this account and assign it to the XSLT Access privilege set. By enabling the Guest account, web users will be able to access your RSS feed without entering a password. If you want to password protect your XSLT published data, simply disable the Guest account and create real accounts (with passwords) for the XSLT Access privilege set. When you’re finished, click OK to dismiss the Define Accounts \u0026amp; Privileges dialog box.\nYou can now copy the new database to your FileMaker Server and open it with FileMaker Server Admin.\nWriting an XSLT Template Loosely put, XSLT is a language for converting from one kind of XML to another, or from XML to HTML. XML goes in one side, and different XML comes out the other. As mentioned previously, you are going to use XSLT to make data from your database accessible as an RSS feed. An RSS feed is just some special XML data that can be accessed over the web. An RSS feed looks like this:\n\u0026lt;rss version=\u0026#34;2.0\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;channel\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;My Company News\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;link\u0026gt;http://www.mycompnay.com/news/\u0026lt;/link\u0026gt; \u0026lt;description\u0026gt;News about my company.\u0026lt;/description\u0026gt; \u0026lt;item\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;A Sample Press Release\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;description\u0026gt;Content goes here\u0026lt;/description\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/item\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/channel\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/rss\u0026gt; The rss entity wraps the entire document, just like the messages entity did in the sample document above. Inside rss, you find the channel, which has a title, link, and description. Additionally, the channel entity has one or more item entities inside it. The item entity represents a single story or article. In this sample, you will produce an RSS file with an item entity for each record in the database.\nThe fmresultset XML Format Now you know what the output of your XSLT template will be. But what about the input. FileMaker data is a database, not an XML file so how can XSLT process it? Simple: The Web Publishing Engine extracts information about your database, and the data in it, from FileMaker Server and converts it to a standard XML format. Once this is done, the XSLT Publishing system can convert that XML into whatever you want; in this case, into RSS.\nSo to successfully use XSLT Publishing you need to understand FileMaker’s XML format and how to interact with it. Here is an example of XML data from the FileMaker database you just created:\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE fmresultset PUBLIC \u0026#34;-//FMI//DTD fmresultset//EN\u0026#34; \u0026#34;/fmi/xml/fmresultset.dtd\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;fmresultset xmlns=\u0026#34;http://www.filemaker.com/xml/fmresultset\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;error code=\u0026#34;0\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;metadata\u0026gt; \u0026lt;field-definition name=\u0026#34;Release Date\u0026#34; result=\u0026#34;date\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;field-definition name=\u0026#34;Title\u0026#34; result=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;field-definition name=\u0026#34;Content\u0026#34; result=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/metadata\u0026gt; \u0026lt;resultset count=\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;record mod-id=\u0026#34;1\u0026#34; record-id=\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;field name=\u0026#34;Release Date\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;data\u0026gt;02/20/2007\u0026lt;/data\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/field\u0026gt; \u0026lt;field name=\u0026#34;Title\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;data\u0026gt;Title Goes Here\u0026lt;/data\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/field\u0026gt; \u0026lt;field name=\u0026#34;Content\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;data\u0026gt;Content Goes Here\u0026lt;/data\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/field\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/record\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/resultset\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/fmresultset\u0026gt; The root node in FileMaker’s XML format is called fmresultset because it holds a set of results from FileMaker. The first entity inside, called error, tells you what error, if any, occurred while fetching data. In this example, the code attribute has a value of 0, meaning there was no error. This error code is very important because it helps you understand what is going wrong when you try talk to FileMaker.\nNote: Many parts of a fully complete fmresultset document have been omitted from this sample for simplicity. When you see real results from FileMaker later, you’ll also see all the parts that were left out here. This sample shows only the most important pieces. Up next is the metadata element. Metadata is a geeky word meaning information about the data in the document. In an fmresultset document, the metadata entity includes one field-definition element for each field whose data is included. In this example, all three fields in your database are included. The field-definition element includes the name and type of the field.\nAfter the metadata comes the real data. The resultset entity holds the data and tells you how many records are included (one in this case). Within the resultset entity, you will find one record entity for each record. The record entity in turn holds field entities —one for each field. Finally, the data entities hold a single value from a field (a repeating field would have more than one data entity, but normally you will have just one data entity per field).\nA document with more records would simply have more record entities in its resultset entity. So you can see that this XML format can successfully represent any set of FileMaker records imaginable.\nTransforming XML Many first-time XSLT users make the mistake of assuming XSLT is a scripting language. It is not. Others believe XSLT must be about generating text output, like PHP. It is not. Thinking like that will only leave you frustrated as you try to make sense of the errors your XSLT templates are producing.\nXSLT is a tree transformation language. In one side it reads tree in the form of an XML document. Out the other side comes a new tree, usually as new XML or HTML data. But inside, it’s all about trees. The inbound XML is converted into a tree structure in your computer’s memory. The XSLT system then processes this tree, transforming it into a new tree (with new nodes and new branches). Then, once the new tree is fully formed, it is converted into XML or HTML as appropriate.\nFor this example, you need to create an XSLT template that can transform an fmresultset document into an RSS document. A quick review of both formats makes it pretty clear how to do this, at least conceptually. First you need to produce the rss, channel, title, link, and description nodes. These don’t use any data from the database at all, so you can just hard-code them in your XSLT template. Then you need to create an item entity in the RSS result for each record in the FileMaker resultset. The text and entities inside the RSS item entity come directly from the field and data entities in the FileMaker fmresultset.\nBut first, you need to get some procedural steps out of the way. It may come as a surprise, but XSLT is in fact just another XML format. Yes, exactly. You create an XML file to transform another XML file into a third XML file. It is all a bit mind-bending if you think about it too much. At any rate, the XSLT file always starts like this:\n\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:stylesheet version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; exclude-result-prefixes=\u0026#34;xsl fmxslt fmrs fmq prop\u0026#34; xmlns:fmq=\u0026#34;http://www.filemaker.com/xml/query\u0026#34; xmlns:fmrs=\u0026#34;http://www.filemaker.com/xml/fmresultset\u0026#34; xmlns:fmxslt=\u0026#34;xalan://com.fmi.xslt.ExtensionFunctions\u0026#34; xmlns:xsl=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\u0026#34; xmlns:prop=\u0026#34;http://www.filemaker.com/xmlproperties\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:output encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34; indent=\u0026#34;yes\u0026#34; method=\u0026#34;xml\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; The first line is simply a requirement. Technically, every XML file should begin with a line like this (and most do). It tells any computer system that cares to look that this file is in fact XML.\nThen you come to the root node of an XSLT file. The xsl:stylesheet entity wraps up the entire stylesheet. This root node, though, also includes some important information. It declares a flock of namespaces, each with its own prefix. Each of these will be used at some point in the XSLT file. The exclude-result-prefixes attribute simply informs XSLT that when it finally produces the output XML, you don’t want it to include these namespace prefixes in the final XML. This just helps to keep the output XML clean and compliant.\nNote: Unlike the XML samples you have seen before, the xsl:stylesheet entity in this example is split across several lines. This is perfectly legal. Notice that it starts with \u0026lt;xsl:stylesheet, but it doesn’t end until the \u0026gt; seven lines later. The xsl:output element tells XSLT what format to produce when it is finished transforming. Once the final output tree has been constructed, the XSLT system will serialize the data to plain text. The way it does this depends on where you plan to send the result. In this case, you are producing XML output, but sometimes you may choose HTML instead, if you are producing a web page.\nNow you’re ready to begin writing the transformation code. XSLT operates by matching templates in the XSLT file to nodes in the incoming tree. When a match is found, it is used to produce a portion of the output tree. To kick things off, you need a template that will match just once for the fmresultset document. The code looks like this:\n\u0026lt;xsl:template match=\u0026#34;/fmrs:fmresultset\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;rss version=\u0026#34;2.0\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;channel\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;My Company News\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;link\u0026gt;http://www.mycompnay.com/news/\u0026lt;/link\u0026gt; \u0026lt;description\u0026gt;News about my company.\u0026lt;/description\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- the items go here --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/channel\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/rss\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:template\u0026gt; This template (denoted by an xsl:template entity) matches the node called /fmrs:fmresultset in the incoming XML. /fmrs:fmresultset is something called an XPath expression that refers to the root fmresultset entity. XPath uses a syntax much like a file path on your computer: it starts with a slash (/) and then the root entity name. You could add another slash, and then the name of some entity inside fmresultset to refer to that entiy. XPath is quite powerful and you’ll see a few more of its syntactic capabilities shortly. But for now, note that this template matches the root fmresultset entity. As such, it will be applied just once (since there is only one fmresulset in the incoming document).\nThe code inside the xsl:template entity simply defines the sort of output that should be produced. In this case, it is going to output the rss entity and its children. (Notice that the item entities, which need access to FileMaker record data, have not been added yet.) If you were to run this template as is, it would output an RSS file with no items in it.\nNow you need to add those items. This is the point where an experienced developer who is new to XSLT begins to get confused. Many first-timers start by trying something like this:\n\u0026lt;xsl:template match=\u0026#34;/fmrs:fmresultset\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;rss version=\u0026#34;2.0\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;channel\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;My Company News\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;link\u0026gt;http://www.mycompnay.com/news/\u0026lt;/link\u0026gt; \u0026lt;description\u0026gt;News about my company.\u0026lt;/description\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:template match=\u0026#34;/fmrs:fmresultset/fmrs:resultset/fmrs:record\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;item\u0026gt; ... \u0026lt;/item\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:template\u0026gt; ... The thinking goes something like this: The first template matches the begin fmresultset tag, and outputs the top part of the file. Then the second template matches each record, and dumps out an item entity for each one.\nBut remember that XSLT is tree-based. In the tree representation of an XML file above, there is no concept whatsoever of a begin tag or an end tag. So the first assumption is flawed. The first template in this snippet matches the fmresultset node in the incoming document. That node starts at the top of the file and ends at the bottom. Any notion of a start tag is long gone by the time the XSLT begins to apply templates.\nThe next flaw in reasoning is the idea that you can “output the top part of the file.” Trees, trees, trees. There is no file. The attempt to output the first part of a file is really an attempt to produce half an rss node and half a channel node (the other halves are at “the bottom of the file”). Because XSLT is tree-based, this concept is nonsensical. The XSLT system either adds a new node to the output tree or it doesn’t. It can’t add half a node.\nTo correct this reasoning, you must recognize two facts: First, the template above matches the entire fmresultset node, from top to bottom. There’s no way to match the beginning in one template and the end in another. And second, the content of an xsl:template entity must be fully formed entities. In other words, any XML entity that is begun in a template must be ended in the same template.\nBecause of this, XSLT templates aren’t constructed like normal programs. They don’t run form the top to the bottom like a PHP script (or a FileMaker script for that matter). Although there are many ways to write an XSLT stylesheet, they tend to operate form an outside-in perspective when you consider the final output file. You build the root node of the output tree, then add nodes to it, then add more nodes to those nodes. The root node effects both the very top of the output file and the very bottom.\nA corrected version of this template looks like this:\n\u0026lt;xsl:template match=\u0026#34;/fmrs:fmresultset\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;rss version=\u0026#34;2.0\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;channel\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;My Company News\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;link\u0026gt;http://www.mycompnay.com/news/\u0026lt;/link\u0026gt; \u0026lt;description\u0026gt;News about my company.\u0026lt;/description\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:for-each select=\u0026#34;./fmrs:resultset/fmrs:record\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:call-template name=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:for-each\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/channel\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/rss\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:template name=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;item\u0026gt; ... \u0026lt;/item\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:template\u0026gt; In this version, the xsl:for-each entity is used to loop through all the record entities in the input document. Another template is called for each record. The second template is a named template (it has a name attribute) rather than a template that automatically matches a node in the incoming tree. The result is that the second template will be called once for each record, adding an item node to the output tree each time.\nThe item template needs to be finished now. This is the first place where you need to access the actual FileMaker data. To refresh your memory, the item entity should look like this in the final document:\n\u0026lt;item\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;A Sample Press Release\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;description\u0026gt;Content goes here\u0026lt;/description\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/item\u0026gt; The content of its title element comes from the Title field in FileMaker. Likewise, the description element is fed by the Description field. The field data is simply another node in the incoming tree, in this case the text node inside the data entity. So accessing this information is no different than accessing any other XML entity: you use an XPath expression again. The XPath to access the Title field of the first record would look like this:\n/fmrs:fmresultset/fmrs:resultset/fmrs:record[0]/fmrs:field[@name=\u0026#39;Title\u0026#39;/fmrs:data/text() That’s a mouthful, so it will help to break it down. The first portion simply uses the path-like notation of XPath to work down the XML structure to the record entities:\n/fmrs:fmresultset/fmrs:resultset/fmrs:record The [0] at this point simply tells XPath that you expect it to find more than one record entity, and you want just the first one (you would use [1] to get the second, and [2] to get the third). Then you have another path component to reference the field entity inside the selected record. This time, you see [@name='Title']. Again, you expect multiple field entities in a given record, but instead of selecting the one you want by number, you use an attribute value. @name='Title' means “select the field entity in this record that has a name attribute with the value ‘Title’.” In other words, get the Title field. As you probably recall, the FileMaker xml format has a data entity inside each field, and the next portion of the path accesses this entity. Finally, the code text() tells XPath to extract the text content of the data entity. The end result is the text in the Title field.\nBut you can actually shorten this expression significantly. Remember that this item template was called inside an xsl:for-each loop. XSLT has a notion of context. It knows at what point in the incoming tree you are currently working. The xsl:for-each entity loops over a set of nodes in the tree, and sets the context accordingly each time. So when the template is called for the first record, the context will be that record entity. In XPath, a single period (.) represents the current node. So the XPath expression to extract the Title field value can be shortened to this:\n./fmrs:field[@name=\u0026#34;Title\u0026#34;/fmrs:data/text() In other words, “from the current record, find the field entity whose name attribute is “Title” and get the text from its data entity.”\nBut how do you put this data into the output tree? You use another xsl entity, called xsl:value-of. This code produces a valid RSS item entity:\n\u0026lt;item\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:value-of select=\u0026#34;./fmrs:field[@name=\u0026#34;Title\u0026#34;/ fmrs:data/text()\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;description\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:value-of select=\u0026#34;./fmrs:field[@name=\u0026#34;Content\u0026#34;/ fmrs:data/text()\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/description\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/item\u0026gt; The title and description entities both include content retrieved from the FileMaker data.\nIf you put all these parts together, you get an XSLT file that looks like this:\n\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:stylesheet version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; exclude-result-prefixes=\u0026#34;xsl fmxslt fmrs fmq prop\u0026#34; xmlns:fmq=\u0026#34;http://www.filemaker.com/xml/query\u0026#34; xmlns:fmrs=\u0026#34;http://www.filemaker.com/xml/fmresultset\u0026#34; xmlns:fmxslt=\u0026#34;xalan://com.fmi.xslt.ExtensionFunctions\u0026#34; xmlns:xsl=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\u0026#34; xmlns:prop=\u0026#34;http://www.filemaker.com/xmlproperties\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:output encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34; indent=\u0026#34;yes\u0026#34; method=\u0026#34;xml\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:template match=\u0026#34;/fmrs:fmresultset\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;rss version=\u0026#34;2.0\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;channel\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;My Company News\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;link\u0026gt;http://www.mycompnay.com/news/\u0026lt;/link\u0026gt; \u0026lt;description\u0026gt;News about my company.\u0026lt;/description\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:for-each select=\u0026#34;./fmrs:resultset/fmrs:record\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:call-template name=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:for-each\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/channel\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/rss\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:template name=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;item\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:value-of select=\u0026#34;./fmrs:field[@name=\u0026#39;Title\u0026#39;]/fmrs:data/text()\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;description\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:value-of select=\u0026#34;./fmrs:field[@name=\u0026#39;Content\u0026#39;]/fmrs:data/text()\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/description\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/item\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:stylesheet\u0026gt; Using a text editor, put this code in a file and call it “pr.xsl” so FileMaker will know it is an XSLT stylesheet. XSLT files need to be stored in a special location on the FileMaker Web Publishing Engine machine in order to be accessible by the XSLT Publishing system. On Windows, the files go here:\nC:\\Program Files\\FileMaker\\FileMaker Server\\Web Publishing\\xslt-template-files\\ On Mac OS X they go here:\n/Library/FileMaker Server/Web Publishing/xslt-template-files/ Copy the pr.xsl file to the correct location in your web publishing environment. To access an XSLT file in your web browser, you use a URL like this:\nhttp://yourserver/fmi/xsl/pr.xsl\nAs with other FileMaker Web Publishing URLs, the /fmi part informs your web server that this request should be sent to the Web Publishing Engine, and the /xsl part tells FileMaker you’re asking for XSLT Publishing. After the /fmi/xsl/ part, you simply append the name of your XSLT stylesheet.\nNote: If you have a lot of XSLT stylesheets, you can create folders in the xslt-template-files folder, and put your stylesheets in those folders. If you do, the URL changes to this: http://yourserver/fmi/xsl/foldername/filename.xsl. In other words, you need to include the folders in the path. Also, note that the server name or IP address in this URL must refer to your web server computer.\nIf you access this URL right now, you will see an error in your browser. An XSLT file like the one you just created cannot be accessed directly by name because FileMaker has no way of knowing which database to fetch data from, which layout to use, and which records to get. There are two ways to give FileMaker what it needs. The first is to include the necessary information in the URL itself. You can also add the required information to the XSLT file itself. You’ll try the URL method first. Revise the URL to look like this:\nhttp://yourserver/fmi/xsl/pr.xsl?-db=Press+Releases\u0026amp;-lay=Press+Releases\u0026amp;-grammar=fmresultset\u0026amp;-findall\nThis version of the URL includes something called a query string (the part after the question mark) that passes important parameters to FileMaker. The first, -db=Press+Releases tells FileMaker to access the Press Releases database. Since spaces are not allowed in URLs, you simply replace the space in the name with a plus sign (+). The next parameter is -lay=Press+Releases. This tells FileMaker which layout to use. The layout in turn tells it which table is being accessed, which table occurrence on the Relationship graph to use, and which fields should be included in the result. The next parameter, -grammar=fmresultset tells FileMaker that your XSLT file is expecting its data using the fmresultset XML format. FileMaker can actually use a few different XML formats, but you should always use fmresultset unless you have a good reason not to. A final parameter tells FileMaker you want to find every record in the table: -findall. Each of these parameters is added to the URL with an ampersand (\u0026amp;) in between.\nWhen you visit this revised URL, you should see something. If your browser supports RSS directly, you’ll see the data formatted nicely for easy reading (FireFox, Safari, and Internet Explorer 7 all support RSS). If you are using an older browser, you may see just the raw XML output, or even a blank page. You can use the View-\u0026gt;Source feature in your browser to see the underlying XML if it can’t display it reasonably. At this point you only need to confirm that the RSS XML was produced properly.\nNote: If you are using Safari on Mac OS X and have the web publishing environment installed on your local machine, you may bump in to a Safari bug. It sometimes doesn’t like RSS feeds served from localhost. Just use 127.0.0.1 as the server address if your feed is served from the local machine and Safari won’t display it properly. You can also use an RSS reader program (like NewsGator or NetNewsWire) to access your FileMaker data. Figure 10 shows the data from the FileMaker database in three different programs.\nFigure 10The RSS feed you just created is shown here displayed in three different programs. In the back, the feed is being displayed in the FireFox web browser. In the middle, a news aggregator called NetNewsWire is displaying the feed. In the front, you see the RSS capabilities of the Safari web browser. In every case, the data is the same, but each application provides its own interface and features. This demonstrates the power of XML standards.\nIt would be more convenient to access your feed if you didn’t have to add the complicated (and always the same) –db, -lay, -grammar, and –findall parameters to the URL every time you visited it. You can update the XSLT stylesheet so it automatically applies each of these values using something called processing instructions. When FileMaker processes the XSLT stylesheet, it reads these instructions to figure out which database to access, and so forth. It is easy to do; just add this line below the \u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026quot;1.0\u0026quot; encoding=\u0026quot;UTF-8\u0026quot;?\u0026gt; line in your XSLT file:\n\u0026lt;?xslt-cwp-query params=\u0026#34;-grammar=fmresultset\u0026amp;-db=Press+Releases\u0026amp;-lay=Press+Releases\u0026amp;-findall\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; This processing instruction line includes all the parameters that previously had to be added to the URL. Add this line to your file, save it, and copy it back to the Web Publishing Engine computer. Now you can access your feed with this simple URL:\nhttp://yourserver/fmi/xsl/pr.xsl\nThis time, FileMaker can access the correct data with no additional parameters.\nBuilding More Complex XSLT Web Applications ust like the PHP API, the XSLT Publishing system can do much more than just fetch records and reformat them. Using additional custom URL parameters, you can instruct FileMaker to perform finds, edit records, create new records, run scripts, and more. You’ll learn a little more about FileMaker’s URL syntax in the section on XML Publishing below. You can also refer to the PDF document FMSA8_Custom_Web_Guide included on the FileMaker Server Advanced CD-ROM. This file includes comprehensive documentation of all FileMaker’s XSLT Publishing commands.\nIn fact, if you intend to make heavy use of XSLT Publishing, it will be helpful to read the XML Publishing section for several reasons. Remember that XSLT Publishing is built on top of XML Publishing. Not only does the XML Publishing system help you understand what commands you can use to interact with FileMaker, but examining the output of XML Publishing commands can be an important debugging tool when working with XSLT. At any time, you can enter an XML command in your browser’s location box to see the actual XML produced by FileMaker before the XSLT system begins to process it. This is a necessary step for all but the most trivial XSLT stylesheets.\nThe XSLT Site Assistant Many web-based database systems have very similar functionality. You often need web pages that perform basic operations like listing records, displaying full record details, and editing records. FileMaker Server Advanced includes a tool that can generate a series of XSLT web pages for you based on the structure of your database. This is rarely enough to build your entire site in one step, but it does serve as a good jumping off point when you need to build a complete web site. The tool is called the XSLT Site Assistant, and it can be installed on your development computer from the FileMaker Server Advanced CD-ROM.\nOnce you have installed the Site Assistant, it is relatively self explanatory. Launch the application and enter the address of your FileMaker Server computer. Select your database, and click Next. The site assistant then presents you with a series of options. Here you tell it what capabilities you want the generated site to have. Figure 11 shows the screen.\nFigure 11The FileMaker Site Assistant can create an XSLT-based web site for you. You just tell it what features the site should have.\nYou simply turn on or off checkboxes as appropriate. The Site Assistant also lets you select which FileMaker layout each web page should be based on. The fields on the selected layout determine what fields will be included on the web pages.\nWhen you’ve finished making selections, click Create. You are prompted for a location to save the generated files, then the Site Assistant goes to work creating custom-crafted XSLT. When it is done, you simply copy the generated files to a folder in the xslt-template-files folder on your Web Publishing Engine computer. Then access the site with the appropriate URL. For example, if you put the files in a folder called “mysite” you could access the site with this URL:\nhttp://myserver/fmi/xsl/mysite/home.xsl\nWhen you do, you’ll see something like Figure 12.\nFigure 12The home page of a site created with the Site Assistant is not much to look at, but all the functionality is there. Click the links to begin the action you want to take. You’ll find that this site is quite full featured.\nWarning: It cannot be stressed enough that the Site Assistant is not a learning tool. It is a convenience for building a web site that will have basic database operations. If you want to better understand XSLT, you should read a book or online resource on the topic. The XSLT produced by the Site Assistant is typical of computer-generated code: it is perfectly functional. But it is unnecessarily complex and difficult to learn from. For instance, the Site Assistant assumes every field may be a repeating field, so it adds extra code every time one is displayed to deal with the possibility. You should use the site assistant once you are comfortable with XSLT or if you have no need to make customizations to its generated pages beyond just cosmetics. XML Publishing The last FileMaker Web Publishing technology is also the least glamorous, at least from an end-user’s perspective. XML Publishing exists only to allow other computer programs to access FileMaker data intelligently. The result is never pretty; rather it simply returns unformatted FileMaker XML.\nThe real power of the XML Publishing system is what is called a RESTful interface. This just means it uses normal web technologies (URLs, HTTP communication, and XML data) to expose a programming interface. The advantage of such an approach is its broad applicability. Nearly every scripting language or programming environment on earth can speak HTTP and process XML. For example, if you want to access FileMaker data from a Ruby or Perl script, you could easily use the XML Publishing system to do it. The script would create a URL of the correct form, send it to the Web Publishing Engine, and then capture the results.\nYou’ve already seen the format FileMaker uses to respond to these special requests: it simply returns fmresultset XML documents. All you need to understand is how to send requests. FileMaker’s URL syntax for XML requests is extremely flexible and powerful. You can fetch individual records, perform finds, add, edit, or delete records, run scripts, fetch value lists, find out about databases and layouts, and extract data from container fields.\nXML Publishing Commands Every URL you send to the XML Publishing system starts off the same way:\nhttp://yourserver/fmi/xml/fmresultset.xml\nThis beginning tells your web server to talk to the Web Publishing Engine, and tells the Web Publishing Engine that you expect it to send you back XML in the fmresultset format. It is what comes after this portion of the URL that gets the work done. Take this URL for example:\nhttp://yourserver/fmi/xml/fmresultset.xml?-db=my_database\u0026amp;-lay=my_layout\u0026amp;-findall\nThis URL includes a special parameter, called an action parameter that tells it what kind of action you want it to take. In this case, the URL includes the –findall action. This tells FileMaker you want it to find and return every record in a table. FileMaker supports the following actions:\n-dbnames to request the name of every database accessible by XML Publishing -layoutnames to request the name of every layout in a database -scriptnames to request the name of every script in a database -new to create a new record -delete to delete a record -dup to duplicate a record -edit to edit an existing record -find to find based on criteria -findall to find every record -findany to find a single random record -view to retrieve the data about a table or layout without actually returning any records Common URL Parameters Most of these actions require additional parameters to work properly. For instance, you cannot get layout names from a database without telling FileMaker which database to access. You specify a database using the –db­ parameter. For example:\nhttp://yourserver/fmi/xml/fmresultset.xm?-db=my_database\u0026amp;-layoutnames\nThis URL would request the names of layouts in a database called “my_database.” Only the –dbnames action can be used without specifying a database as well. –layoutnames and –scriptnames both require only a database name.\nEvery other action requires both a database and a layout. The layout is specified using the –lay parameter. The layout specification is more important than it may seem at first. Just as in a FileMaker script, the layout gives FileMaker its context. Once you have selected a layout, FileMaker knows which table it needs to work with. If you include related data, FileMaker knows where to start in the Relationship graph by determining which Table Occurrence is associated with the selected layout. Finally, when FileMaker gathers field data to return, it includes only the fields on the chosen layout.\nAny action that specifically targets a single record must have the record specified by internal record id using the –recid parameter. For example, this URL will delete a record:\nhttp://myserver/fmi/xml/fmresultset.xml?-db=my_database\u0026amp;-lay=my_layout\u0026amp;-recid=1234\u0026amp;-delete\nThis URL instructs FileMaker to delete the record whose ID is 1234. It is important to note that this is not the value in an ID field in the database. Rather, it refers to an ID FileMaker uses internally to refer to the record. You can discover the ID of any given record by inspecting the record-id attribute of the record in the fmresultset XML data.\nIf the command being sent to FileMaker needs to include field data, you simply add parameters, each matching a field name. For example, to change the First Name field of a particular record to “Steve” you could use this command:\nhttp://myserver/fmi/xml/fmresultset.xml?-db=my_database\u0026amp;-lay=my_layout\u0026amp;-recid=1234\u0026amp;First+Name=Steve\u0026amp;-edit\nNotice that this URL uses the –edit action parameter, which tells FileMaker to edit a record. It also specified which record to edit using –recid. This URL includes a parameter called “First+Name.” This parameter must match the name of a field in the database. (Again, because URLs can’t have spaces, the space in the field name has been replaced with a plus sign. The actual field is still called “First Name.”)\nYou use this same field name technique to perform find requests:\nhttp://myserver/fmi/xml/fmresultset.xml?-db=my_database\u0026amp;-lay=my_layout\u0026amp;First+Name=Mary\u0026amp;-find\nThe above URL tells FileMaker to find every record with Mary in the First Name field.\nAdditional Parameters The parameters explained above provide a huge amount of capability. But XML Publishing includes a lot of additional parameters for more specialized purposes. They include:\nParameters to limit the number of record returned in one request (-max) and to page through a found set (-skip).\nParameters to control how find requests are processed. This includes performing or versus and searches (-lop) and using special find operators for exact match, less than, greater than, and so forth (fieldname.op=).\nParameters to execute scripts (-script, -script.prefind, -script.presort) and pass parameters to them (-script.param, etc…).\nParameters to control record sorting (-sortfield, -sortorder).\nBy combining parameters, you can get exactly the results you want from the XML Publishing system.\nInterpreting Errors Because the XML Publishing commands are flexible and require a lot of careful typing, it is easy to make mistakes. When you do, FileMaker will return an XML response that includes an error code. Proper interpretation of this code can save you hours of troubleshooting.\nTip: Interpreting the XML results in any way requires that you be able to see it. Most web browsers will display the XML results of an action nicely formatted in the browser window. The notable exception is Safari on Mac OS X, which (somewhat correctly) displays nothing since the XML has no style information with it. If you do your XML Publishing development on a Mac, do yourself a favor and download FireFox for testing. You can look up the error code in the FileMaker help system (look for the entry about the Get(LastError) function for a complete list). Alternately, you can google “FileMaker Error ###” where ### is the exact error number, and almost always find a brief explanation of the problem. Unfortunately, the explanation of an error code is not always obviously helpful. Some common errors and their causes are shown below.\nError #4 (Comand is Unknown) or #5 (Command is invalid): This error usually means you mis-typed your action parameter. Every URL you send to FileMaker must include one of the action parameters described above (-new, -edit, -find, and so on).\nError #-1 (Unknown): This error sometimes comes back when you forget to include a database (-db).\nError #958 (Parameter Missing): This usually means you did not specify a layout or database or forgot to specify an action.\nError #802 (Unable to Open File): This usually means you have mis-typed the database name, the database is not open on the FileMaker Server, or the database does not have the “Access via XML Publishing” custom privilege enabled.\nError #102 (Missing Field): This error crops up a lot. Inevitably, you have specified a field in the URL that is not on the target layout, or you have mis-typed the field’s name. A particularly pernicious cause is a field whose name in FileMaker ends with a space: invisible in FileMaker but important in the URL.\nConclusion If you are new to web development in general, web publishing in any form can seem overwhelming. But FileMaker has a web publishing option that is suitable for just about any need. With a little practice with HTML, plus XSLT or PHP, you can build very powerful web sites and services that interact directly with your FileMaker database. Once you get started, it is hard to stop: web publishing is so powerful you’re sure to get hooked.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/forhire/filemaker-web-integration/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"FileMaker Web Integration"},{"content":"It seems like Microsoft Excel is installed on just about every PC in the world. As such, a lot of new FileMaker developers are already Excel wizards. In fact, many new FileMaker projects begin life as a replacement for an Excel spreadsheet that has outgrown itself. If you are an Excel star trying to wind your way through the FileMaker universe, you may be stymied at first by all the things you thought you knew that just don\u0026rsquo;t seem to apply anymore. In this article, you\u0026rsquo;ll learn how to make the most of your Excel expertise and get up and running in FileMaker in no time.\nImagine you are the sole proprietor of Parthenon Party Supplies, a purveyor of themed party products. Like a lot of small business owners, you use Excel to keep track of just about everything. But lately you\u0026rsquo;ve grown weary of Excel\u0026rsquo;s one-view-fits-all model, it\u0026rsquo;s hopeless dependence on copy/paste to make use of data in multiple places, and less-than-perfect tools to sort the data and find what you\u0026rsquo;re looking for. In fact, you\u0026rsquo;ve decided to upgrade to FileMaker because you\u0026rsquo;ve heard it handles business data and processes deftly. Your first task is to move your spreadsheet of products from Excel into FileMaker. Figure 1 shows the spreadsheet you\u0026rsquo;re starting with.\nFigure 1This is your Products spreadsheet. It includes a product list and simple price calculator.\nNow before the hate mail starts flying, it is important to note that Excel is an outstanding program well suited to many tasks. Every FileMaker developer you\u0026rsquo;ll ever meet probably also uses Excel all the time. Excel is particularly suited to general analysis of a set of numbers, financials, and graphing applications — in these areas, FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s best response is to graciously step aside. But when it comes to managing business data, FileMaker reigns supreme.\nRows and Columns Excel has a very open-ended rows-and-columns approach to handling data, but FileMaker is decidedly more rigid. Your first step is to create a FileMaker table that can hold the same kind of data you\u0026rsquo;ve entered into your spreadsheet. In most cases, this means three things:\nFirst, you need a \u0026ldquo;Table\u0026rdquo; for each type of item you\u0026rsquo;re tracking. This will often (but not always) correspond to a worksheet. In this case, your are tracking just products, so you need just one table. Second, your table needs a \u0026ldquo;Field\u0026rdquo; for each individual attribute of a product. This usually means one field for each column in your spreadsheet. Finally, you will add a record to the table for every individual product. In other words, you\u0026rsquo;ll have one FileMaker record for each row in the spreadsheet.\nDatabase Structure The most obvious difference between a spreadsheet and a database is that spreadsheets care very little about the structure of the data they hold. When you create a new Excel file, you\u0026rsquo;re presented with seemingly infinite little cells into which you can type. Excel is like a gracious host: \u0026ldquo;Make yourself at home.\u0026rdquo;\nA new FileMaker file, on the other hand, is more like your highschool girlfriend\u0026rsquo;s father. It\u0026rsquo;s twenty questions before you even get your foot in the door. In fact, the very first thing you see when you make a new database is an imposing dialog box asking you to \u0026ldquo;define\u0026rdquo; your database. In this window, you tell it exactly what kinds of things you\u0026rsquo;re keeping track of, what information you want to know about them, and how they all fit together.\nIt may seem daunting at first, but by asking for details right up front, FileMaker knows a lot more about your data than Excel ever could — knowledge it puts to good use. Like exactly how many products you carry. When you want to rearrange the product list (using the Records → Sort command) it knows that there are preciesly five things you can sort by, and you can specify one by name. It knows that you may want to look at your products in a list, but you\u0026rsquo;re just as likely to want a larger view, with room for notes and pictures, and when you add this larger view, it knows that even though there are two ways to look at a product, it is really just one product. When you change a description, it can change it in both places at once automatically, with no special hand holding on your part.\nAs you start to migrate things from Excel to FileMaker, just remember to think about your data before you start defining. If you are managing two completely different things (customers and products for example) then you\u0026rsquo;ll want to store them in different FileMaker tables. And although a row in a spreadsheet usually corresponds to a record in FileMaker, this isn\u0026rsquo;t always the case. Your Employees spreadsheet might have a separate employee in each column, with their information listed on several rows. In this case, you\u0026rsquo;ll want a record for each column, and a field for each row. Just remember: A table for each type, a field for each attribute, and a record for each individual.\nTo get started, in FileMaker Pro, choose File → New Database. FileMaker will first ask you what to call your database, and where to put it (answer any way you like here, then click Save). Next you see FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s Define Database dialog box. This is where you tell FileMaker how your database should be structured.\nTo start you off, FileMaker has created a table for you and named it the same as the database itself. Chances are you\u0026rsquo;ll want to rename that table:\nClick the Tables tab.\nYou see a list of tables in your database (in this case there is just one item in the list). Click on the table in the list.\nFileMaker highlights the table and shows its name in the Table Name box at the bottom of the window. Change the text in the Table Name box to Products and click Change.\nThe list now shows a Products table. With the table successfully renamed, you can switch back to the Fields tab. This is where you\u0026rsquo;ll tell FileMaker what kinds of information you want to enter about a product. Your spreadsheet has five columns of product information:\nPart# Description Price Cost Margin The first four are normal columns, into which you type information. But Margin is special because it uses a formula in Excel to automatically calculate its value. You will learn how to deal with this shortly. For now, you\u0026rsquo;ll ignore the Margin column and add fields for just the first four.\nAdding fields is easy. First, type the field name in the Field Name box. Then pick an appropriate data type from the Type pop-up menu. Finally, click Create. For Part# and Description, you should use the Text type. For Price and Cost, pick Number instead. When you\u0026rsquo;re finished, your Define Database window should look suprisingly like Figure 2.\nFigure 2Here\u0026rsquo;s the Fields tab of the Define Database dialog box with a field for each column in the spreadsheet. You\u0026rsquo;re just about ready to enter some data.\nNow you can click OK to close the Define Database window. FileMaker shows you an exceedingly sparse window with your four fields. To make yourself feel a little more at home, choose View → View as Table. FileMaker now shows your table in a more spreadsheet-like way, with a row for each record and a column for each field.\nAt this point, you are free to enter data. Type in a part number, description, price, and cost. To resize a column, simply click between two column headings and drag to the right or left, like you would in Excel. When you\u0026rsquo;re ready to add a new product, choose Records → New Record. A new blank row will appear immediately after the first one. To get rid of a record you\u0026rsquo;ve already created, choose Records → Delete Record\u0026hellip; instead. Although you need to be more explicit, you\u0026rsquo;ll quickly discover that managing records this way is a breeze. You no longer need to make sure you select every column before deleting a row, and there\u0026rsquo;s no way to accidentally get your rows mixed up from column to column.\nFormats and Decorations Now that you have a place to put your data, you can start to mold the way it looks to match what you are used to. Your spreadsheet does FileMaker one better in two ways: First, the price and cost look like dollar amounts in Excel. Second, the spreadsheet has an attractive grey bar across the top that declares this to be a list of \u0026ldquo;Products.\u0026rdquo; You can easily accomplish both of these in FileMaker.\nWhen you defined the price and cost fields, you told FileMaker they should hold numbers. But a number can be anything from a dollar amount to a size to an employee ID. When it comes time to show the number on screen, FileMaker can automatically format it in any way you want, much like the Number tab in Excel\u0026rsquo;s Format → Cells window.\nThe look of a database is controlled by the something called a Layout in FileMaker. Right now you have just one layout, but you\u0026rsquo;re actually free to create as many as you want. No matter how many you have, though, if you ever want to change the way something looks, you first need to switch to Layout Mode. You do this by choosing the View → Layout Mode command. When you make the switch, you\u0026rsquo;ll see that the spreadsheet-like look has disappeared. Don\u0026rsquo;t be alarmed — you\u0026rsquo;ll lear more about this soon. For now, just try to hold yourself together long enough to make a few changes.\nOnce in Layout Mode, click on the Price field (The little rectangle with Price written inside it) to select it. Then, with the Shift key held down, click on the Cost field. Now both fields are selected, so you can modify them both in one shot. Now choose the Format → Number\u0026hellip; menu command, and FileMaker will show you its Number Format dialog box (Figure 3).\nFigure 3This is how the Number Format dialog box looks when you\u0026rsquo;ve asked FileMaker to format a number to look like a dollar amount. This same window lets you control how negative numbers appear, control the use of commas, display percentages, and more.\nIn the Number Format window, choose Format as decimal. Then turn on \u0026ldquo;Fixed number of decimal digits\u0026rdquo; and make sure its associated box has \u0026ldquo;2\u0026rdquo; in it. Finally, turn on the \u0026ldquo;Use notation\u0026rdquo; check box, choose \u0026ldquo;Currency (Leading/Inside)\u0026rdquo; from its pop-up menu, and make sure there is a dollar sign in the Currency Symbol box. When you\u0026rsquo;re finished, click OK.\nTo view the results of your layout changes, switch back to Browse Mode by clicking View → Browse Mode. If FileMaker asks you if you want to save your changes, click Save. Your Price and Cost fields should now look just like they did in Excel.\nNext, you need to add the grey title bar across the top of the window. This is even easier, and if you\u0026rsquo;re in the mood to explore, you\u0026rsquo;ll quickly discover that FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s window decorating powers far exceed what Excel can do, both in flexibility and simplicity.\nTo get started, switch back to Layout Mode. While Excel only knows about rows and columns, FileMaker divides the working space in a window into useful chunks called Parts. In a new layout like the one you\u0026rsquo;re creating, you automatically have three parts: Header, Body, and Footer. But because you previously opted for the spreadsheet view style, these parts don\u0026rsquo;t automatically display in Browse Mode. To change this, first choose Layouts → Layout Setup and click the Views tab in the resulting dialog box. Then click the Properties button (right by Table View). Finally, turn on the \u0026ldquo;Include header part\u0026rdquo; checkbox. Click OK twice to close both open dialog boxes when you\u0026rsquo;re done.\nNow any changes you make to the header part in Layout Mode will show up in Browse Mode too. To find the header part, look at the top portion of the window, near the left edge. You\u0026rsquo;ll see a little tag with the word Header in it (see Figure 4). This tag and the dotted line that extends from it, mark the bottom of the header part.\nThe first thing you need to do is make the header bigger. Simply click and drag the header tag down so that the part is about half an inch tall. Next, you need to give the header part a grey background color. Figure 4 shows how to do this.\nFigure 4To color the header, first select the header part tag. Then click the Fill color tool and pick a color that suits your fancy.\nWith the header part nicely colored, you can now add the title text. This step couldn\u0026rsquo;t be easier. First click in the header part (anywhere you want) then just start typing. Type the word \u0026ldquo;Products\u0026rdquo; and then click somewhere outside the text box that has appeared. FileMaker leaves a little text block behind, selected and ready for you to style and position. To style it, choose the appropriate commands from the Font, Size, and Style submenus in the Format menu. Then drag the text into the top-right corner of the part. If the header isn\u0026rsquo;t big enough to hold your text, just drag it a little bigger. This is the artistic side of FileMaker and you\u0026rsquo;re free to arrange things any way you want. When your done, switch back to Browse Mode and compare your work with Figure 5.\nFigure 5Here\u0026rsquo;s a visually enhanced version of the database. Yours could look like this, or it might be orange with purple wingdings. FileMaker is flexible.\nFormulas If your the nerdy type, you might be thinking \u0026ldquo;big deal\u0026hellip; can it do Formulas?\u0026rdquo; After all, Excel may look like a word processor designed by the folks behind the Medicare Drug Benefit, but it goes way beyond entering text in myriad little boxes. Its real power lies in its ability to derrive new information from the data you give it by applying a healthy dose of math. FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s answer to this basic need is the Calculation Field. Now is a good time to add that formulaic Margin field from the spreadsheet.\nFirst, choose File → Define → Database, and switch to the Fields tab. In the Field Name box, enter \u0026ldquo;Margin\u0026rdquo; and, from the Type pop-up menu, choose Calculation. Finally, click Create. FileMaker pops up the slightly scary Define Calculation dialog box. This is sort of like Excel\u0026rsquo;s Insert Function command and a powerful formula editor all in one. In here, you\u0026rsquo;ll define the formula this calculation field will use to determine its value.\nThe formula for the cell in Excel looks like this:\n=(D4-E4)/E4 In other words, subtract the cost from the price and divide the result by the cost. The FileMaker equivalent looks almost the same, although it is decidedly more readable. (Why doesn\u0026rsquo;t Excel let you use such an easy-to-read formula? Because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t know about your data structure the way FileMaker does.) Here it is:\n(Price - Cost) / Cost To enter this formula, you\u0026rsquo;re free to type it directly in the big empty box in the Define Calculation dialog box. If typing gets you down, you can double-click any field from the list in the top-left corner of the window to have its name entered in the formula box for you. Either way, make sure you get the parentheses, the divide symbol, and all three fields in the right place. Also, be sure Number is chosen in the \u0026ldquo;Calculation result is\u0026rdquo; pop-up menu in the bottom-left corner of the winodw. When you\u0026rsquo;re done, click OK, and then click OK again in the Define Database window.\nThe Formula for Formulas As the Margin field demonstrates, translating from an Excel formula to a FileMaker calculation is usually a seriously easy operation. FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s calculation language is very similar to Excel\u0026rsquo;s. To make your life easy, keep these things in mind (and don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to consult the FileMaker help file or your favorite FileMaker book — some of these topics are beyond the scope of this article):\nCell references are usually replaced with field names. In most spreadsheets that make sense as a database, this is a one-to-one process. But if your formula referrs to cells on several different rows, you might be in trouble. If every record should share one value, use a Global Field. Otherwise, you may be swimming upstream. FileMaker is not a spreadsheet, and some jobs just make more sense in Excel.\nIf a row in your spreadsheet uses summarization functions (SUM(), AVERAGE(), COUNT() etc\u0026hellip;) across all rows, use a Summary field. Summary fields support all the same operations, and have loads more power if you also use Sub-Summary and Trailing Grand Summary parts.\nExcel\u0026rsquo;s AND() function doesn\u0026rsquo;t translate to FileMaker as you might expect. While in Excel you would say AND(F1\u0026gt;10, F1\u0026lt;100), FileMaker expects something like F1 \u0026gt; 10 and F1 \u0026lt; 100. Just string together as many comparisons as you need, with \u0026ldquo;and\u0026rdquo; betwen each one. The same goes for OR().\nUnlike Excel\u0026rsquo;s one-line input box, FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s calculation window offers up a huge amount of space to work with. Use it. You can add extra space and blank lines anywhere you want in a calculation as long as it isn\u0026rsquo;t in the middle of a field or function name. So space things out, use multiple lines, and indent as you see fit. You can even add comments anywhere in a calculation using special symbols like this: /* this is a comment */\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve ever battled a complex formula with lots of nested IF() functions in Excel, you\u0026rsquo;ll appreciate the Case function in FileMaker. It lets you consider an unlimited number of conditions with no nesting at all.\nMost Excel functions have a FileMaker equivalent with a very similar name (often the same name). The list in the top-right corner of the Define Calculation window lists all of FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s functions. Use the pop-up menu above this list to focus on a single category of functions. You can even add your own functions to FileMaker using FileMaker Advanced and the Define → Custom Function menu command.\nJust like Excel, FileMaker calculations aren\u0026rsquo;t limited to numbers. You can create dynamic text values that change based on data, calculate future due dates, and more. FileMaker can even use pictures, PDFs, and other data in Container fields as the result of a calculation.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re using a fresh install of FileMaker, chances are the Margin field is now on the layout to the right of Cost. But if you\u0026rsquo;ve made changes to FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s preferences, you may need to add the field to the layout yourself. Either way, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to tell FileMaker this field should hold a percentage.\nFirst, switch to Layout Mode again. If the Margin field isn\u0026rsquo;t already there, you can add it most easily by making a copy of the Cost field and switching its field setting. With the Option (Mac) or Control (Windows) key held down, drag the Cost field down a few notches. When you release the mouse, FileMaker will ask you what field you want to show. Choose the Margin field from the list.\nTo change the Margin field to a percentage, select it and choose Format → Number\u0026hellip; again. Turn on \u0026ldquo;Format as decimal\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Fixed number of decimal digits\u0026rdquo; as before. This time, though, choose Percent from the \u0026ldquo;Use notation\u0026rdquo; pop-up menu. Click OK.\nIf you switch to Browse Mode, you\u0026rsquo;ll see your Margin field properly placed and formatted. If you change the Price or Cost on a product record, the Margin will automatically recalculate just like the Excel original.\nNon-Data The top-right corner of your spreadsheet shows something called the Pricing Tool. This isn\u0026rsquo;t really data at all. Instead, it is a little tool to help you decide on a price. You type in the cost of a product, and your desired margin, and it tells you the price you need to charge. At first glance, you might think this simply doesn\u0026rsquo;t fit in FileMaker. But the truth is, FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s ability to add actual functionality (tools, automated processes) to a database is vast.\nThere are a dozen ways to add a similar pricing tool to your FileMaker database, but here you\u0026rsquo;ll use the most Excel-like method. As you become more familiar with FileMaker, you could improve this functionality using scripting — something that is easier than you would think.\nThe cells in the Pricing Tool allow you to enter data, so it makes sense that they should be fields. But they don\u0026rsquo;t hold attributes of any particular thing (you don\u0026rsquo;t have pricing tool fields for every product). Instead, they have only one value each no matter how many records you add to your database. As such, they\u0026rsquo;re a perfect candidate for Global fields — special fields that have only one value for all records.\nChoose File → Define Database and switch to the Fields tab. You need to add three global fields. The first two (Pricing Tool Cost and Pricing Tool Margin) will accept user input. The third (Pricing Tool Price) will be a calculation based on the others.\nIn the Field Name box, enter Pricing Tool Cost. From the Type pop-up menu, choose Number. Then click Create. Finally, click the Options button. In the window that appears, switch to the Storage tab. Here, turn on \u0026ldquo;Use global storage (one value for all records).\u0026rdquo; This turns the field into a Global field.\nRepeat these steps again, this time naming the new field Pricing Tool Margin.\nNow add a third new field called Pricing Tool Price. This time, though, choose Calculation from the Type pop-up menu. When the Define Calculation dialog box appears, enter this calculation:\nPricing Tool Cost * Pricing Tool Margin + Pricing Tool Cost Before you click OK, click Storage Options and turn on \u0026ldquo;Use global storage\u0026rdquo; for this field as well. Now click OK a few times until you return to your database window. Now switch to Layout Mode. If FileMaker added the three new fields to the layout, move them one-by-one into the Header. If they were not added, add them yourself just like you did the Margin field. This time, though, move them all into the Header part.\nYou can arrange these fields however you like, and add text labels as appropriate. For example, you might arrange them something like this:\nPricing Tool: [COST FIELD] [MARGIN FIELD] = [PRICE FIELD]\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget to use the Format → Number command to format each field appropriately. Also, note that you can control the background of a field just like you did the Header part. Finally, you can add borders to a field using the Format → Field/Control → Borders menu command. When you switch back to Browse Mode, your pricing tool should be fully operational.\nAbove and Beyond You now have a FileMaker database that closely matches the original Excel spreadsheet. It is already better than the spreadshet in many ways. It can hold more data (Excel\u0026rsquo;s 65,000 row limit is downright paltry when you consider that FileMaker can easily hold millions of records). FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s sorting (Records → Sort Records\u0026hellip;) and finding (View → Find Mode) capabilities far exceed Excel\u0026rsquo;s. When it comes to scientific data, FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s 400 decimal places of precision put Excel to shame.\nBut these statistics belie the bigger picture. A FileMaker database is far more than a spreadsheet. Choose View → View as Form and you\u0026rsquo;ll see that your spreadsheet list of rows instantly turns to a one-page-at-a-time view more suitable for large amounts of data. In Layout Mode, you can even make entirely new layouts (Layout → New Layout) to display the same data in totally different ways. Why not print a product flyer right from FileMaker? Just make a layout that is as big as a single page and arrange the data appropriately, including another text field for marketing text, and a Container type field for a picture of the product.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;re ready to add Customer and Order tracking to your database, you just add a few more tables with their fields. You can then wire the tables together in the Relationships tab of the Define Database window — tell FileMaker that a customer record is associated with one or more order records, and that each line item on an order ties to one product in the products table. Now FileMaker can display related data side by side (a list of orders on the Product layout, for example) and completely irradicate duplicate data entry.\nAnd when your business really starts to grow, you can add scripts to automatically email sales receipts to your customer with the click of a button, or generate purchase orders for new inventory when stocks run low.\nFinally, with a second (or third, or 150th) copy of FileMaker, you can have multiple people all working in your database at exactly the same time. No more yelling across the office to ask someone to close the spreadsheet. FileMaker is designed from the ground up to support muliple users.\nIn short, FileMaker lets you build a real business application, Managing data is just the first step. And as an Excel wizard, you\u0026rsquo;re well positioned to tackle the data management side of FileMaker in stride — and move on to the more exciting stuff.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/advisor/make-the-switch-from-excel-to-filemaker/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Make the Switch from Excel to FileMaker"},{"content":"Narnia-inspired costumes this year courtesy of Grandma Schultz.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/flickr/halloween/2006-queen-susan-and-queen-lucy/","tags":["Photos"],"title":"Queen Susan and Queen Lucy"},{"content":"Relationships hold a special place in the world of a database designer: They\u0026rsquo;re simultaneously your most powerful tool and the most difficult to figure out. If your first trip to FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s Relationships tab left you scratching your head, you\u0026rsquo;re not alone. FileMaker goes a long way towards making relationships easy to set up, manage, and use. But the real trick is understanding the concepts behind relationship building. In this article, you\u0026rsquo;ll learn how to add a sprinkling of relational capability to your own FileMaker database.\nYou already know that FileMaker is a first-class choice for managing information about the things you deal with every day. Maybe you have a database of all your customers, or the subscribers to your Mineral Water Monthly news letter, or all the vintage Pez dispensers you have up for sale on eBay. Whatever it is you\u0026rsquo;re keeping track of, you add fields to hold the individual bits of information (these bits of information are usually called \u0026ldquo;attributes\u0026rdquo;). Since every customer or subscriber has a First Name, your database probably has a First Name field. And those Pez dispensers each have a Date Purchased, a Condition, and a Picture.\nBut what happens when a particular attribute can have several different values at the same time? Customers might have more than one address, for instance. Or suppose you wanted to keep track of previous owners on each of your Pez dispensers. Now you\u0026rsquo;re asking a FileMaker field to do double (or triple or quadruple) duty. There are a lot of ways to pull this off in FileMaker, namely:\n1: You could just put several things in one field, perhaps with a comma between each one. This is a certifiably terrible idea though. First, how do you handle something like an address, which is spread across several fields? Also, all those commas can be a nuisance to keep track of, and if someone forgets one, it can quickly become confusing interpreting your data. What good is storing all this data if you can\u0026rsquo;t figure it out later? This method should be reserved for only the very simplest situations, and even then you should think twice.\n2: You could define several fields with similar names. For example, you might have Previous Owner 1, Previous Owner 2, and Previous Owner 3. This is the method most new users jump to first, because it is a relatively obvious solution. Although it isn\u0026rsquo;t a bad approach, it isn\u0026rsquo;t a very good one either. Before long, you\u0026rsquo;ll end up with so many fields you won\u0026rsquo;t know what to do with yourself. Besides, this approach requires that you know up front how many fields to create. How many previous owners will a Pez dispenser have? Maybe just one or two. But what if someday you get one with five? You\u0026rsquo;ll have to revisit your field definitions and make changes to your layouts to make room for more.\n3: You could use a repeating field. When you define a field, you can click the Options button in the Define Database dialog box. From there, under the Storage tab, you\u0026rsquo;ll find a box where you can enter a \u0026ldquo;Maximum number of repetitions.\u0026rdquo; If you give a field four repetitions, FileMaker will show you four copies of that field on the layout, and you can put something in each one. Repeating fields can seem like an elegant solution to this problem, but they\u0026rsquo;re not perfect. Although they keep your field count from getting out of hand, they don\u0026rsquo;t solve any of the other problems with #2 above. More importantly, they\u0026rsquo;re hard to search, print, export, or summarize. And repeating fields have another big disadvantage: they make you look like a FileMaker Newbie—every experienced FileMaker developer knows repeating fields are a no-no.\nIt turns out the best way to get your multiple-values fix is to use a related table. In the Pez dispensers example, you would add a second table to your database whose whole job is keep tabs on the previous owners of your treasures. You then instruct FileMaker how to tell which owners go with each dispenser and you\u0026rsquo;re done. This is all easier said than done, so here\u0026rsquo;s how you do it:\nCreating a Relationship Suppose you have a file called \u0026ldquo;Pez Dispensers\u0026rdquo; with one table and fields with these names and types (if you\u0026rsquo;re not sure what the ID field is all about, see Always Carry Identification):\nID (Number) Name (Text) Date Released (Date) Date Purchased (Date) Condition (Text) Always Carry Identification If you\u0026rsquo;ve spent any time at all nosing around in a FileMaker database with more than one table, you\u0026rsquo;ve almost certainly noticed the proliferation of fields with \u0026ldquo;ID\u0026rdquo; in their name. In a well-designed system, every major table has its own ID field, and additional fields that hold ID values from the tables it relates to.\nRelational databases are all about hooking records together. Customers have orders. Projects have tasks. And Students have test scores. FileMaker connects records by matching data in fields. Two records in two different tables are \u0026ldquo;related\u0026rdquo; if they both have a particular field value in common. You get to decide which fields FileMaker uses to make the match, and you\u0026rsquo;re free to pick just about any field you want. But bear in mind that this matching is what ties your whole system together. While you could always link a customer to their orders by Full Name, what happens if the customer gets married and decides to change their name? If you change it in the customer record, you\u0026rsquo;ve broken the link to all their old orders. Likewise, what if someone else orders from you and happens to have the same name? They\u0026rsquo;ll suddenly be connected to all the original person\u0026rsquo;s orders, which is obviously not correct.\nThese examples point out why ID fields are necessary. An ID field is simply any field that is always unique and never ever changes. Since fields like that are hard to find in your normal data, most developers elect to make up their own for each record. Nine times out of 10, the ID field for a record is just a number field that automatically gets the next bigger number whenever a new record is created. In FileMaker this is called a Serial Number, and you can make an ID field like this easily. Just make a new number field, then click the Options button. Under the Auto-Enter tab, turn on \u0026ldquo;Serial number,\u0026rdquo; and tell FileMaker what number to start with and how much to add to it for each new record. You should get in the habit of adding serial-number-based ID fields to every new table you create.\nNow you want to add the concept of previous owners. Each previous owner has a Name and its own Date Purchased. Your first task is to add a new table to your database:\nChoose File → Define Database and switch to the Tables tab.\nFileMaker shows you the one-and-only table in your database. You\u0026rsquo;re about to add another one. In the Table Name box, enter \u0026ldquo;Previous Owners\u0026rdquo; then click Create.\nThe new table is added to the list. Although you have a table, it isn\u0026rsquo;t very useful yet because it has no fields. Switch to the Fields tab, and make sure Previous Owners is selected in the Table pop-up menu at the to of this window.\nYou see a barren field list, waiting for you to sew the seeds of data. Add a Number field called Pez Dispenser ID.\nThis field will hold the ID of the pez dispenser that this owner is attached to. For clarification, see Always Carry Identification. Add a Text field called Name and a Date field called Date Purchased.\nNow you\u0026rsquo;ve finished your table. Each record in this table can hold exactly one previous owner. By now you already know which owners go with which dispensers. Each previous owner has the ID of his pez dispenser in the Pez Dispenser ID field. Unfortunately, FileMaker isn\u0026rsquo;t nearly as clever as you are, so you\u0026rsquo;ll have to explain this simple concept to it. This is the Relationship part. You tell FileMaker how these two tables go together by defining a relationship between them. In this case, you\u0026rsquo;ll tell it that the ID field in the Pez Dispenser table is supposed to match the Pez Dispenser ID field in the Previous Owners table.\nSwitch to the Relationship tab in the Define Database dialog.\nYou see two odd rectangles (Figure 1) that are named after your tables. These little buddies are Table Occurrences and they make up your Relationship Graph. It is your job to add the relationships to this graph.\nFigure 1Figure 1: FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s Relationships tab shows how the tables in your database fit together. Right now you have two tables, but no relationships, so these table occurrences are completely unattached.\nClick on the ID field in the box labeled Pez Dispensers and, with the mouse button held down, drag over the Pez Dispenser ID field in the Previous Owners box.\nAs you drag, a line follows your mouse arrow. When you release the button, the line stays behind (Figure 2) connecting the two boxes.\nFigure 2Figure 2: Now the two table occurrences are connected by a thin black line. This line represents a relationship. You can tell at a glance that these two tables are related to one another by the two ID fields.\nIf you accidentally connect the wrong fields, just click the [=] on the line between the table occurrences and press the Delete or Backspace key on your keyboard. Then try again.\nNow you have two tables and one relationship. Technically, you can stop right here and tell all your friends you\u0026rsquo;re now a relational database developer. But chances are you\u0026rsquo;re still wondering what in the world you can do with this relationship. Well, lots. First of all, what happens if you delete a Pez Dispenser from your database (maybe your dog swallowed it, changing its condition from \u0026ldquo;Like New\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Severe Cosmetic Defects\u0026rdquo; and you\u0026rsquo;ve decided you simply don\u0026rsquo;t want it anymore). If you delete the record, what happens to the related Previous Owner records? Well, left to its own devices, FileMaker will gladly leave them there as what a seasoned database pro would call \u0026ldquo;orphans:\u0026rdquo; related records (Previous Owners) that no longer have a necessary parent record (Pez Dispenser). FileMaker simply can\u0026rsquo;t know which records you consider to be the parents, or primary records, and which are thus the child records—the records that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t exist without a parent.\nLuckily, you can tell FileMaker more about a relationship so it knows what to do in a situation like this. To edit the relationship you just defined, double-click the big [=] box in the middle of its line. You can also click the box once, then click the pencil button under Tables/Relationships at the bottom of the window. Either way, you\u0026rsquo;ll see the Edit Relationship dialog box, which is also pictured in Figure 3.\nFigure 3Figure 3: Although creating a relationship is a drag-and-drop affair, to access the more advanced relationship settings you need to visit the Edit Relationship dialog box.\nFor now, focus your attention on the bottom third of the dialog box, where you see two sets of three checkboxes. Above each set, FileMaker tells you which table the settings apply to. In this case, the Pez Dispenser table is on the left and the Previous Owners is on the right. The only options you should be concerned with right now is \u0026ldquo;Delete related records in this table when a record is deleted in the other table\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Allow creation of records in this table via this relationships.\u0026rdquo; Turn on both these options and FileMaker will treat these as a true parent-child relationship. You\u0026rsquo;ll be able to make new Previous Owner records right from the Pez Dispenser layout, and when you delete a pez dispenser record, the related previous owners will automatically be deleted as well.\nWith your relationship fully defined, you can click \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo; a couple of times to close the various dialog boxes on your screen and return to your database window. If you check the Layout pop-up menu in the status area, you\u0026rsquo;ll see that FileMaker has created a Previous Owners layout for you. Since you\u0026rsquo;ll be managing previous owners from the main Pez Dispenser layout, you can delete this new layout if you want.\nUsing Related Data on Layouts Figure 4 shows a (very simple) Pez Dispenser layout. Right now it doesn\u0026rsquo;t show or allow the user to edit the previous owner information. Luckily, using related data in FileMaker is a breeze.\nFigure 4Figure 4: This is how a Pez Dispenser layout might look before you tell it about Previous Owners. To take advantage of the new table and relationship you just created, you can add a portal. Portals show scrolling lists of related records on a parent record\u0026rsquo;s layout.\nIf you add a field to this layout now, you\u0026rsquo;ll discover that FileMaker shows Previous Owners in the pop-up menu at the top of the field list. With no fanfare at all, you\u0026rsquo;re free to drop any of the fields from the related table right on this layout, where they\u0026rsquo;ll work just like ordinary fields. For example, if you add the Name field from the Previous Owner table occurrence to the layout, FileMaker will show you the name of the first related Previous Owner when you view the layout in browse mode. You can change the name directly (assuming the field is enterable) and even use it in searches and sorts, just like fields from the Pez Dispenser table.\nBut the whole point of this exercise was to support multiple Previous Owners for one Pez Dispenser. So seeing and editing the first is probably not what you had in mind. To display data from several related records at once, you use something called a \u0026ldquo;portal.\u0026rdquo;\nSelect the Portal tool in the Status area (make sure you\u0026rsquo;re in layout mode first).\nFigure 5 shows you the oft-overlooked Portal Tool.\nFigure 5Figure 5: The portal tool lives with all the other tools in the Status area when you\u0026rsquo;re in Layout mode. Just click it once and you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to \u0026ldquo;draw\u0026rdquo; a portal on the layout.\nClick and drag a rectangle somewhere in the open space on your layout.\nFileMaker shows a dotted rectangle as you drag. When you release the mouse button, the Portal Setup dialog box appears. In the \u0026ldquo;Show related records from\u0026rdquo; pop-up menu, choose Previous Owners.\nThis tells FileMaker which table to get the portal\u0026rsquo;s data from. It will automatically decide which records to show based on the relationship you defined to that table. Turn on \u0026ldquo;Allow deletion of portal records\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Show vertical scroll bar.\u0026rdquo;\nPortals have a handfull of settings, which you\u0026rsquo;re free to explore. In this case, you have told FileMaker that you want to be able to delete Previous Owner records right from this layout. You\u0026rsquo;ve also elected to allow FileMaker to show a scroll bar if the number of related records doesn\u0026rsquo;t fit in the space you give the portal. Click OK.\nFileMaker now asks which fields you want to include on the portal. You can always add or remove fields later simply by dragging them around in layout mode. Move Name and Date Purchased to the Included Fields list, then click OK.\nYou are now back on the layout, and your new portal is ready to use. You may want to add a label to your portal by copying one of the field labels and changing its name. Figure 6 shows the new-and-improved layout. You can type directly into the fields in the portal to edit them. Whenever you enter in a row, a new blank row appears below it, ready for more. If you are in a portal field when you choose the Records → Delete Record command, FileMaker will ask you if you want to delete the Master (Pez Dispenser) or Related (Previous Owner) record, so if you add an owner you don\u0026rsquo;t really want, you can easily delete it.\nFigure 6Figure 6: This version of the layout has the portal in place and ready to use. Working with a portal is intuitive and easy for anyone who is familiar with editing records in FileMaker.\nWith some relationship power and a little portal lovin\u0026rsquo;, your improved database can hold—and display—an unlimited number of previous owners with no dirty tricks and only a few new fields. This is just a small sample of what you can do with relationships, but it is a start. Using the same techniques outlined here, you can create databases with several tables all connected and acting as one larger system.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/advisor/create-smarter-databases-with-relationships/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Create Smarter Databases with Relationships"},{"content":" The Gold Bug Variations (Print) by Richard Powers The Magician\u0026#39;s Nephew (Audio) by C.S.

Sure, you could select all items in a Finder window, copy them, and then paste the data into a text editor, but you\u0026rsquo;d wind up with a chaotic list of file names with no order. Fortunately, Unix can take organization up a notch. Using the Terminal, you can create a file that lists a folder\u0026rsquo;s contents, which you can then edit and print.\nWhat you need Mac OS 10.2 or later ($129, www.apple.com) BSD subsystem installed (part of the Mac OS X standard installation) Need a printout of a folder\u0026rsquo;s contents? Choose a names list (left) or full file stats (right), and use the Terminal to create a printable file.\nStep 1: Make the List If you just want file names, type ls in the Terminal window after the prompt. If you want file names, sizes, and dates, type ls -lhTR. The -l flag lists the results in long format (including file sizes, owners, and times), the -h flag displays file sizes in meaningful units (like 253KB) rather than bytes (259072) . The -T flag displays the complete time info, and the -R flag lists subfolder contents. Type a space and then drag the desired folder from a Finder window into the Terminal window to display its path.\nYou can list just file names—type ls (or ls -R to include subfolder contents)—or get detailed information.\nStep 2: Create the File To output the results in a text file, type a right-facing arrow \u0026gt;, a space, a quotation mark \u0026quot;, a name for your file with a .txt extension, and another quotation mark. (For example, \u0026gt;\u0026quot;File Listing.txt\u0026quot;.) Press Return to create a file. This gets stored in your Home folder by default if you haven\u0026rsquo;t changed directories since launching the Terminal. You can then open this file using any word processor, edit and print it.\nWith full stats, you see names, owners, sizes, dates, and more.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/macaddict/print-finder-window-content/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Print Finder Window Content"},{"content":"Apple\u0026rsquo;s accomplished the impossible with AMac OS X: It\u0026rsquo;s created an operating system that geeks, grandmas, creative types, business-minded peeps, and even kindergartners can love. And not only does it offer a user-friendly and stylish graphical interface, but it\u0026rsquo;s got Unix at its core. While a productive Mac-head need not care a whit about Unix, that\u0026rsquo;s not to say a little Unix can\u0026rsquo;t come in handy.\nWhen a Mac quick-fix eludes you, the Terminal-OS X\u0026rsquo;s handy portal to its Unix side- can save the day. Here are three dilemmas you may encounter, and how to use the Terminal to circumvent them. Fire up the Terminal (in Applications \u0026gt;Utilities), put on your propeller beanie, and dive in!\nBack Everything Up What you need Mac OS 10.2 or later ($129, www.apple.com) BSD subsystem installed (part of the Mac OS X standard installation) Administrator access Storage medium (such as a CD-R, DVD-R, or external hard drive) Hard drives are not fail-safe, and you should know by now that backing up is the best advice anyone can offer. But if you try backing up your whole hard drive in the Finder (so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to reinstall all of your apps, retweak preferences, and whatnot), you\u0026rsquo;ll discover something else: Copying it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work. The trouble is with permissions. When you copy a regular file in the Finder, you own the new file-no matter how the original was set. But your Mac contains files (such as system files) that you can\u0026rsquo;t read or copy, and if you share your Mac, you can\u0026rsquo;t access other users\u0026rsquo; files. With the Terminal, you can sidestep both of these limitations.\nBacking up your startup disk can be a real drag—literally. Our drag- and-drop method allows easy backups without pesky permissions problems.\nStep 1: Create the command… Unix commands are typed on the command line, the space after the prompt in the Terminal. The default prompt is your user name followed by a percentage sign (%)—for example, gwcoffey%. If you\u0026rsquo;re a Panther user, type sudo ditto -V -X -rsrcFork afterthe prompt, and then type a space (but don\u0026rsquo;t press Return). The sudo (superuser do) command gives you superhuman privileges to use particular commands with \u0026ldquo;root\u0026rdquo; permissions—meaning you can do anything. The ditto command invokes the ditto tool, which can copy entire directories. The -V flag tells ditto to display file names in the Terminal as it copies them so you can monitor progress, the -X flag tells ditto to ignore other disks beyond the startup disk, and the -rsrcFork flag preserves resource forks and HFS metadata. Unfortunately, Jaguar doesn\u0026rsquo;t support ditto\u0026rsquo;s -X flag, so you can\u0026rsquo;t back up your startup disk in one fell swoop. But you can back up folders one at a time. Just type the same command but leave off the -X flag, and drag one folder instead of your entire startup disk (you\u0026rsquo;ll have to repeat all steps for every folder). If that\u0026rsquo;s more trouble than it\u0026rsquo;s worth, Carbon Copy Cloner (www.bombich.com) is a nifty piece of donationware that\u0026rsquo;ll do the trick for you.\nOn the command line, every space and letter is Important. Make sure you type the command exactly as you see It here.\nStep 2: Drag the source… Next, tell Unix which folder or disk to copy by adding its path, the string of directory names separated by / that leads to your source, to the command line. To do this, simply drag your target\u0026rsquo;s icon from the Finder into the Terminal window (in Panther, you can\u0026rsquo;t drag disk icons from the Finder Sidebar; select Computer from the Finder\u0026rsquo;s Go menu to find icons fit for dragging). After dropping the icon on the Terminal window, the Terminal automatically displays the correct path. If you drop in your startup disk, the path will be short—just a /. It\u0026rsquo;ll be much longer for a nested folder (for example, for your iTunes Music folder, you\u0026rsquo;d get this path: /Users/user name/Music/iTunes\\ Music). Then type a space (don\u0026rsquo;t press Return).\nTo ensure you give Unix the right path to your source, drag the targeted file, folder, or disk into the Terminal window—no breadcrumbs needed.\nStep 3: Drag the destination… Lastly, let ditto know where to copy your files. If you\u0026rsquo;re backing up to another hard drive, simply drag its media icon into the Terminal window to display its path. If you want to back up to a CD– or DVD–R, put a blank disc in your drive and drag its icon into the Terminal window. However, know this: ditto is a dummy when it comes to size limitations. It won\u0026rsquo;t tell you if your source disk\u0026rsquo;s files exceed the space on your destination disc or disk—it\u0026rsquo;ll dutifully copy for 45 minutes and then complain when it runs out of room. It\u0026rsquo;s up to you to make sure there\u0026rsquo;s enough space on your backup media to accommodate your startup disk. If you run into space constraints, create a new folder on your desktop and drag it onto the Terminal window to serve as the backup destination. You can then burn selected folders and files from it without permission problems.\nDragging this FlreWire hard-drive icon onto the Terminal creates a secondary path that tells ditto where to copy the flies-be sure to type a space between the two paths.\nStep 4: Type the magic word… OK, time to start the copy process. Press Return. The Terminal will ask for your administrator password to provide you with superuser privileges. Type it in and press Return again. That\u0026rsquo;s it. A lot of text will fly across the Terminal screen, letting you know that it\u0026rsquo;s hard at work. Depending on how many MB or GB you\u0026rsquo;re backing up, this can take a while. When the text stops flyin\u0026rsquo; and you see your prompt again, your backup is finished. If you backed up to a CD– or DVD–R, burn the disc by selecting its icon and choosing Burn Disc from the Finder\u0026rsquo;s File menu.\nAs you type your password, nothing shows up onscreen. This is Unix-speak for \u0026ldquo;security.\u0026rdquo;\nFix the Firewall What you need Mac OS 10.2 or later ($129, www.apple.com) BSD subsystem installed (part of the Mac OS X standard installation) Administrator access For extra security, Mac OS X has a built-in firewall. This firewall software makes your computer invisible to prying eyes on the Internet. You can easily activate the firewall; open System Preferences, click the Sharing preference, click the Firewall button, and click Start. Unfortunately, some programs, such as Timbuktu, sometimes modify your Mac\u0026rsquo;s internal firewall settings, so when you try to activate the firewall, OS X tells you it\u0026rsquo;s unavailable unless you deactivate your other software. Luckily, you\u0026rsquo;ve got Unix.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen this error, this fix is for you.\nStep 1: Fire up the command… Launch the Terminal (if it isn\u0026rsquo;t open already), type sudo ipfw flush at the prompt, and press Return. This command first invokes the superuser do root privileges (available to anyone with administrator status). The command ipfw configures the behind-the-scenes IP Firewall settings, and the flush command sets the firewall back to its default settings.\nThis bitty command can easily fix big firewall access problems.\nStep 2: Flush away… The Terminal asks you for your administrator password. Enter this next to its prompt and press Return. The Terminal responds with \u0026ldquo;Are you sure? [yn]\u0026quot;—type y and press Return again. Your Mac quickly goes to work, deleting all pre-existing rules and returning the firewall to the default settings. When it\u0026rsquo;s finished, the Terminal displays \u0026ldquo;Flushed all rules\u0026rdquo; in its window. You can now turn your firewall on and off with ease.\nAfter you give the command to flush out all of your current firewall rules, the Terminal will ask you if you\u0026rsquo;re sure you wantto do this.\nPrioritize Your Processor Power What you need Mac OS 10.2 or later ($129, www.apple.com) BSD subsystem installed (part of the Mac OS X standard installation) Administrator access Storage medium (such as a CD-R, DVD-R, or external hard drive) Mac OS X\u0026rsquo;s multitasking has just one rule: Every active program gets an equal share of your Mac\u0026rsquo;s attention. This equal-opportunity plan works well until your Mac gets really busy. Just as you apply Photoshop\u0026rsquo;s Gaussian Blur to your 50MB photo file, the Microsoft Office Assistant decides to dance its little jig, making everything slow to a crawl. No, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to quit your other apps and force OS X to give its undivided attention to the task at hand-you can simply use the Terminal to tell OS X which programs should receive the most attention. Here\u0026rsquo;s how.\nIf you take multitasking to the extreme, a little processor power play can prevent display hiccups, sound stutters, and gratuitous spinning wheels. (Photograph by Mark Madeo)\nStep 1: ID your apps… Your first task is to find out the process ID of your target program (the one you want to shower power upon and/or the one that\u0026rsquo;s becoming a processor hog). To find this info, just launch Activity Monitor if you\u0026rsquo;re running Panther (in Applications → Utilities) or Process Viewer if you\u0026rsquo;re using an older version of OS X (also in the Utilities folder). In Activity Monitor, select Windowed Processes from the top-right pop-up menu, click the CPU button to display a list of all active apps, and note your target program\u0026rsquo;s process ID number in the Process ID column. In Process Viewer, select User Processes from the Show pop up, select your target app from the list, click the More Info disclosure triangle, and click the Process ID tab to view its process ID.\nIn Panther, use the Activity Monitor to find a program\u0026rsquo;s process ID. With earlier X incarnations, use Process Viewer to get this Info.\nStep 2: Set its priority… Next, tell OS X how important your VIP (very important program) is by using the renice command to make your programs more or less nice. A nice program demands less computing power. A not-so-nice program takes more power for itself. So if Office Assistant\u0026rsquo;s loafing is slowing down more important things, you can tell Word (or another Microsoft Office app) to be less selfish. Every program starts off with a value of zero, but you can choose any number from +20 (the nicest) to -20 (Mr. Grinch) to set its priority. To do this, launch the Terminal and type sudo renice value id, where value is the value of your niceness setting, and id is the process ID of your chosen app (for example, sudo renice -15 619 gave power to our Photoshop task). Then press Return. The Terminal prompts you for an administrator password. Type in your password and press Return again. OS X instantly starts giving your program a little more or less power as requested. Just remember that renice can shift the balance of power, but it can\u0026rsquo;t make your Mac faster.\nThis Unix command lets you decide how your programs behave with one another.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/macaddict/troubleshoot-with-the-terminal/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Troubleshoot with the Terminal"},{"content":" What You Need Mac with DVD-ROM or SuperDrive and Apple DVD Player Mac OS 10.2 or later ($129, www.apple.com) iTunes 3 or later (free, www.apple.com) OSEx 0.0110a1 or later (free, www.cs.buffalo.edu/-afaversa) mAC3dec 1.6 or later (free, http://sourceforge.net/projects/mac3dec) DVD with music Norah Jones: Live in New Orleans, KISS: Live in Las Vegas, Schoolhouse Rock—we\u0026rsquo;ve invested a good chunk of change building up our DVD collection, but must we remain trapped in our abode every time we just want to listen to the music? Heck no. Even though there\u0026rsquo;s not yet a DVD player the size of an iPod, there\u0026rsquo;s still a way to take your DVD tunes on the road. Rip that music right off the disc and put it where Mother Nature intended it to go: iTunes, on a CD, or even on your iPod . The process isn\u0026rsquo;t as easy as ripping CDs, but it\u0026rsquo;s better than shelling out extra to buy a soundtrack CD-if one even exists for your DVD in question. Just remember: Copyright law protects the music on a DVD, so you can only copy music from discs you own.\nWhy confine yourself to the couch when you can take tunes from your DVDs out and about on an iPod or a CD player?\nStep 1: Set Up DVD Player Finding individual tracks on a CD is easy, but they\u0026rsquo;re trickier to find on DVDs because DVD content is organized into titles and chapters. Unless you intend to rip all 14 hours of that Phish concert DVD, you need to find out where each song is stored. Put your DVD into your Mac and launch Apple\u0026rsquo;s DVD Player. From the Video menu, choose either Normal Size or Half Size, depending on how you want it to appear onscreen. Next, select Preferences from the DVD Player menu. In the resulting window, click the Windows tab, select Wide from the Info Window Type pop-up menu, and click OK. Then select Show Info from the Window menu to display your DVD\u0026rsquo;s title and chapter information in a separate info box.\nMake sure DVD Player displays its info window, or ripping your favorite songs will become a guessing game.\nStep 2: Find Your Music To search your DVD\u0026rsquo;s titles and chapters for songs you want, use the arrow buttons on DVD Player\u0026rsquo;s controller or press the arrow keys on your keyboard. When you find the first song, jot down its chapter and title numbers (displayed in the info box), and repeat for all other tracks. Be aware that each DVD has its own track structure—most concert DVDs house the entire music soundtrack under one title with songs stored in separate chapters. Some DVDs categorize content across multiple titles and place songs as separate chapters under each title. Others have a title for each song, with some songs spilling over into more than one chapter. Your job is to figure out which titles and chapters contain the songs you want to rip.\nEvery Mac addict knows pen and paper are old school—we used Stickies to keep track of titles and chapters.\nStep 3: Make Some Choices Once you\u0026rsquo;ve found everything, fire up OSEx, a freeware app that rips DVDs. OSEx can rip only one title at a time, but you can pick as many chapters as you want within it to rip. From the Ti (titles) drop -down, select the title number of your first song from the list (this places a check mark next to it). Then select one or more chapters from the Ch (chapter) drop-down. Click a chapter number to select it; click it again to deselect.\nTo select individual songs (chapters), place a check mark next to the song by clicking it.\nStep 4: Rip It OSEx can rip both audio and video, but since we just want audio, click the Vid (video streams) drop-down menu and deselect all items. If the Sub (subtitles streams) drop-down isn\u0026rsquo;t grayed out, deselect all of its options as well. Many music DVDs feature multiple formats for an audio track (AC3 stereo, DTS surround, and so on). Click the Aud (audio streams) drop-down and choose one in stereo format (one that displays \u0026ldquo;2Ch\u0026rdquo; in its name) or whatever\u0026rsquo;s available. Then click the Fmt (output format) drop-down and select Elem. Streams (this saves tracks as AC3 audio files). If you\u0026rsquo;re ripping multiple songs at once, where each song is one chapter, click the Seg (output segmentation) drop-down, and select Chapter. If you\u0026rsquo;re ripping a song that spans across more than one chapter, select Title instead. Then click Begin. In the resulting dialog, select where to save new files, and click Choose to let \u0026rsquo;er rip. Now\u0026rsquo;s a good time to grab a cup of coffee.\nOSEx keeps you posted with a progress bar. Disregard those MB file progress numbers-they factor In video size, which you\u0026rsquo;re not saving.\nStep 5: Create the Conversion When OSEx is done, you\u0026rsquo;ll have one or more strangely named AC3 files which you\u0026rsquo;ll need to convert into something your Mac can play. To give yourself the choice of burning audio files to CDs or making MP3s, launch mAC3dec, select AIFF from the Format pop-up, and select 48.0 kHz from the Sample Rate pop-up . Then drag all your AC3 files into the mAC3dec window and click Start. The app converts each AC3 file into an AIFF and saves it in the same folder that houses your originals.\nmAC3dec converts AC3 files into formats your Mac understands—we chose AIFF to give ourselves the option to burn a CD or make MP3s.\nHey, What About Me? Don\u0026rsquo;t have a DVD drive in your Mac? You\u0026rsquo;re not completely out of luck. Just hook up your set-top DVD player to your Mac and record the audio directly. If your Mac doesn\u0026rsquo;t have an audio-in jack, you need a USB audio input device like the Griffin iMic ($39.99, www.griffintechnology.com) . You also need recording software, such as Black Cat Systems Audiocorder (shareware, www.blackcatsystems.com).\nJust connect your DVD player\u0026rsquo;s audio outputs to your Mac input via a stereo RCA-to-1/8-inch stereo miniplug cable, and leave the video connected to the TV. Use your DVD remote control to navigate to the song you want, click your software\u0026rsquo;s record button just before the music starts, let the song play, and click stop just after it ends. This simple approach may seem tempting to those who have DVD-ROM drives, but don\u0026rsquo;t be swayed-we found that the quality of music was much better when we ripped it on our Mac.\nStep 6: Put Things Away Once you\u0026rsquo;ve got your AIFFs, give your tracks more appropriate names (if you wish). If you want to create a CD, use your preferred disc-burning app and go to town. If you want MP3s, launch iTunes, press and hold down the Option key, and select Convert To MP3 from the Advanced menu (or Convert to AAC if you\u0026rsquo;re using iTunes 4 or later, and have chosen AAC as your preferred importing encoder in Preferences). In the resulting dialog, navigate to your AIFF files, hold down the Command key, select all AIFF files, and click Choose to convert and import your music into the iTunes Library.\niTunes\u0026rsquo; Advanced menu allows you to convert songs and add them to the library in one fell swoop.\n","img":true,"link":"/archive/macaddict/rip-sound-tracks-from-your-dvds/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Rip Sound Tracks from your DVDs"},{"content":"FileMaker Pro is generally considered the easiest to use powerful relational database available, but it does not have built in support for graphical charting of Data. To accomplish the common and powerful task, developers had two options: Get fast flexible charting from a separate application, which required a time consuming multi step process, or get slow inflexible charting in FileMaker through incredibly complicated and tedious tricks. øAzium Charts puts easy to use, flexible and fast charting right in FileMaker Pro. Finally developers can integrate charts and graphs directly with their FileMaker solutions, and even build a flexible charting module into commercial products, with the help of øAzium Charts.\nThis manual gives you everything you need to know to build simple or complex charting into your FileMaker Pro solutions. The first chapter gets øAzium Charts up and running so you can immediately begin to experiment with the example files included with the plug-in. The second chapter explains the methodology behind charting with the plug-in and provides the basic information necessary to begin adding charts to your FileMaker solutions. It also explains the basic chart types available and the general options most chart types have. The third chapter provides clear step by step examples for using each of the available chart types. Chapter four describes the advanced features available in øAzium Charts, as well as some techniques for more powerful charting.\nIn Appendix A you will find a comprehensive reference style guide to the External Functions provided by the plug-in. Appendix B will be your most visited reference. It includes an exhaustive list of all options and capabilities of each chart type. Appendix C contains a list of common problems and their solutions, to keep you on track.\nIf you have any comments or concerns about this manual, or find any typos, please let us know by sending email to documentation@wmotion.com.\nTable of Contents Requirements Installation Testing the Plug-in Getting Started External Functions IsActive Init Background Options XAxis YAxis Points Draw Requirements Before beginning, make sure you have all the necessary hardware and software to use øAzium Charts. øAzium Charts is a FileMaker Pro plug-in, and thus requires FileMaker Pro 4.0 or later. It will not function with earlier versions of FileMaker. Contact FileMaker Inc. (http://www.filemaker.com) for upgrade or purchasing information.\nThe plug-in is available for Mac OS and Windows 95/98/NT platforms, and is fully PowerPC Native on Mac OS. It will also work properly with older Macintosh hardware based on the Motorola MC68000 series processor.\nInstallation The plug-in itself is called \u0026ldquo;øAaium Charts\u0026rdquo;. To install the plug-in, follow these steps:\nMake sure FileMaker Pro is not running. If it is, choose Quit from the File menu. Find the FileMaker Extensions folder. It is located in the same folder as the FileMaker Pro application itself. Drag the plug-in file into the FileMaker Extensions folder. Launch FileMaker Pro That\u0026rsquo;s it! The plug-in should now be installed and ready to use. Make sure you test that the plug-in was installed properly before trying to use the plug-in (see below).\nTesting the Plug-in Before you begin experimenting with the plugin, you should make sure it is actually installed and functioning properly.\nBring FileMaker Pro to the foreground From the Edit menu choose Preferences, then Application In the Preferences dialog, there is a popup menu that says \u0026ldquo;General\u0026rdquo;. Choose Plugins from this menu. You will see a list of installed plugins. Make sure øAzium Charts is in this list, and that there is an x in the check box next to it. If øAzium Charts is listed and checked, the plugin is ready to use. If you don\u0026rsquo;t see it there, quit FileMaker and go through the installation instructions again.\nNow that the plugin is installed and running, you may want to play with the included example files. They should give you a good idea of the basic charting features available. Be sure to return to this manual for complete coverage of the features of øAzium Charts.\nGetting Started The purpose of this chapter is to get you up and running with øAzium Charts as quickly as possible. Here we will cover the basics of charting with the plugin. After completing this chapter you will be able to add basic charting to your FileMaker Pro solutions.\nøAzium Charts Fundamentals To use øAzium Charts you need to understand the methodology. The FileMaker Pro 4.0 plugin architecture allows the creation of External Functions. These functions are accessible in the Calculation Dialog and thus are available to field definitions and script steps which use this dialog. Essentially you can call external functions from 4 places:\nThe definition of a calculation field. Under Specify in a Set Field script step Under Specify in a Paste Result script step Under Specify Calculation in a replace or replace script step For the purposes of øAzium Chart, Set Field offers all the capabilities of Paste Result with the added advantage that the field being set does not need to appear on the current layout, so there is really no reason to use Paste Result with an øAzium Charts external function.\nBecause everything is accomplished through External Functions, a field must be the target of every external function call or group of calls. This field is not the container field which will receive the chart, but is generally a temp field. Some functions will return information that can help in troubleshooting, but it is not relevant to the end user.\nTo produce a final chart, you execute a series of external functions sequentially, first to set up the chart, then to draw it. øAzium Chart places the completed chart in the container field you specify, and optionally in the record you specify. Using these external functions it is possible to programmatically generate and store any number of charts, and to modify the type, style and data of a chart on the fly.\nGetting Familiar with External Functions If you\u0026rsquo;re new to FileMaker\u0026rsquo;s Calculation engine, external functions may seem a bit daunting at first, and if you\u0026rsquo;re an old hand at advanced calculations, you still need to understand some things about the appropriate use of the øAzium Charts external functions.\nNote: If you are not at all familiar with FileMaker Pro calculations you should first consult the documentation included with FileMaker. It contains detailed information on how to define and use calculations. Beginning with version 4.0 of FileMaker Pro, the calculation engine supports a new function called \u0026ldquo;External\u0026rdquo;. The \u0026ldquo;External\u0026rdquo; function takes two parameters, the name of the External Function to execute and the parameters to send to the External Function. Each plugin you install includes a set of External Functions, including øAzium Charts, and each function has a unique name. To execute an External Function, you simple pass it\u0026rsquo;s name as the first parameter to \u0026ldquo;External()\u0026rdquo; and any parameters it expects as the second parameter. For example, consider this calculation:\nExternal(\u0026#34;OzCh-IsActive\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026#34;) It would execute the OzCh-IsActive external function. This function doesn\u0026rsquo;t expect any parameters, so the second parameter to the External() function above is blank. FileMaker evaluates calculations left to right and inside out, so you can include multiple External Functions in one calculation and even have the result of one function become the parameter of another:\nExternal(\u0026#34;OzCh-InitChart\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Pie|\u0026#34; \u0026amp; Status(CurrentFileName) \u0026amp; \u0026#34;|Chart Field|1\u0026#34; In this example, the first function executed is the Status(CurrentFileName) function, which is replaced by the name of the current database. This becomes part of the OzCh-InitChart parameter, then the external function is executed.\nTo string multiple external function calls together, you can separate each by a \u0026amp;:\nExternal(\u0026#34;OzCh-InitChart\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Pie|My File.fp3|Chart Field|1\u0026#34;) \u0026amp; External(\u0026#34;OzCh-Options\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;axisfontsize=9|axisfontcolor=gray|linewidth=2\u0026#34;) This calculation would first execute the OzCh-Init function, then the OzCh-Options function.\nThree Steps to a Perfect Chart More specifically, there are generally three steps to a finished chart:\nInitialize the chart type.\nIn this step you tell øAzium Charts that you are about to begin a new chart, and what type of chart it will be. When you do this, the plugin forgets all the settings that may have been sent to it for a previous (perhaps unfinished) chart and is ready to begin anew. Set the chart options.\nThis step often involves multiple External Function calls. Each one sets one of a number of options about the chart, including colors, styles, sizes and the actual data to plot. Draw the chart.\nThis is the simplest step. You call one External Function and øAzium Chart puts the finished chart in the correct place, ready to be displayed, printed, copied or stored. Note: Because FileMaker Pro can open multiple files simultaneously, it is recommended that you always perform all three steps in one calculation or in one step. Otherwise, chart commands performed by other files may interfere with the commands you are sending. Types of Charts øAzium Charts supports eight chart types in all:\nPie Charts Line Charts Horizontal Bar Charts Vertical Bar Charts Horizontal Stacked Bar Charts Vertical Stacked Bar Charts Scatter Charts High-Low Charts Each type is explained in detail in the remaining chapters.\nExternal Functions Every aspect of øAzium Charts is handled through External Functions. A complete explanation of each of these functions follows.\nFunction: IsActive Use this function to determine if a user has the plugin installed. You can then display an appropriate error message rather than attempting to generate charts. It has this syntax:\nExternal(\u0026#34;OzCh-IsActive\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026#34;) The IsActive function will return a 1 is the plugin is installed and enabled in the FileMaker Pro preferences. It will return nothing otherwise.\nFunction: Init Use this function when you want to begin a new chart. When this function is called, any previous settings to the plugin are discarded, and it becomes ready to accept commands for the new chart. You should begin every chart with a call to this function. It has this syntax:\nExternal(\u0026#34;OzCh-Init\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026lt;chartType\u0026gt;|\u0026lt;fileName\u0026gt;|\u0026lt;fieldName\u0026gt;|\u0026lt;recordID\u0026gt;|\u0026lt;width\u0026gt;|\u0026lt;height\u0026gt;\u0026#34;) \u0026lt;chartType\u0026gt; (Constant) Can be any one of pie, line, hbar, vbar, hsbar, vsbar, scatter, hilow. Specifies the type of chart to be created. \u0026lt;fileName\u0026gt; (Text) Specifies the file which should receive the finished chart. The chart will be placed in a container field in this file. \u0026lt;fieldName\u0026gt; (Text) Specified the field which should receive the finished chart. The chart will be placed in the field in the file specified by \u0026lt;fileName\u0026gt;. \u0026lt;recordID\u0026gt; (Number/Flag) Specifies which record should receive the finished chart. The chart will be places in the container field specified by \u0026lt;fieldName\u0026gt; in the file specified by \u0026lt;fileName\u0026gt; on the record whose ID is given here. The ID of a record can be determined using the Status(CurrentRecordID) FileMaker built-in function. If the chart will go into a global field, you can specify g rather than a specific record ID. \u0026lt;width\u0026gt; (Number) The width the finished chart image should be, in pixels. \u0026lt;height\u0026gt; (Number) The height the finished chart image should be, in pixels. This function returns no result.\nNote: The \u0026lt;chartType\u0026gt; parameter must be one of the 9 available chart types. Any other value will cause the initialization to fail.\nIf the chart is going to be placed in a global field, the record ID is irrelevant. In this case, pass the letter g as the \u0026lt;recordID\u0026gt; parameter, and the plugin will not try to update a specific record. This way, you do not need to be certain you have a valid record ID before creating the chart.\nThe width and height parameters must be positive integers. Pie charts are always circles, where the height and the width are the same. If the \u0026lt;height\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;width\u0026gt; parameters are different, the smaller of the two will be used.\nFunction: Background Use this function to specify a color or image for the background of the chart. This color or image will appear behind all chart elements, including labels, bars, pie slices, axes, grid lines and plot points. If no background is specified, the background will be white by default. It has this syntax:\nExternal(\u0026#34;OzCh-Background\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;rgb(\u0026lt;redValue\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;greenValue\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;blueValue\u0026gt;)\u0026#34;) // or External(\u0026#34;OzCh-Background\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026lt;colorConstant\u0026gt;\u0026#34;) // or External(\u0026#34;OzCh-Background\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026lt;imageConstant\u0026gt;\u0026#34;) \u0026lt;redValue\u0026gt; (Number) From 0 to 255, the intensity of the red componenet in an RGB color specification. You must use some other tool, like the standard color picker dialog box, to determine the component values of an RGB color. \u0026lt;greenValue\u0026gt; (Number) From 0 to 255, the intensity of the green componenet in an RGB color specification. You must use some other tool, like the standard color picker dialog box, to determine the component values of an RGB color. \u0026lt;blueValue\u0026gt; (Number) From 0 to 255, the intensity of the blue componenet in an RGB color specification. You must use some other tool, like the standard color picker dialog box, to determine the component values of an RGB color. \u0026lt;colorConstant\u0026gt; (Constant) Instructs the plugin to use one of the predefined colors for the chart background. Available colors include: Red Green Blue Black Yellow Magenta Gray Cyan Brown Purple Dkgray Ltblue Burgundy Orange Ltgray Dkblue Pink White \u0026lt;imageConstant\u0026gt; (Constant) Instructs the plugin to use a background image. There are 10 images to choose from, named image1 through image10, and only these images are currently supported. Function: Options The Options function allows you to set special options of various chart types. You pass it a series of parameters, seperated by pipes, where each parameter includes the name of the option to be set and the value to set it to. You can pass as many or as few options in one call as you like. It has this syntax:\nExternal(\u0026#34;OzCh-Options\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026lt;optionLabel\u0026gt;=\u0026lt;optionValue\u0026gt;[|\u0026lt;optionLabel\u0026gt;=\u0026lt;optionValue\u0026gt;]...\u0026#34;) \u0026lt;optionLabel\u0026gt; (Constant) The option to set. Currently, the available options are: \u0026lt;optionValue\u0026gt; (Text) The setting for the option specified in \u0026lt;optionLabel\u0026gt;. The appropriate values vary by \u0026lt;optionLabel\u0026gt; This function returns no result.\nNote: With future versions of øAzium Charts, we may add new capabilities. The structure of the Options function allows us to implement new features without adding more functions or complicating existing functions. Function: XAxis The XAxis function controls display of the x-axis on line and bar charts. It allows you to specify the color and thickness of the axis, as well as the placment and labeling of tick marks. It has this syntax:\nExternal(\u0026#34;OzCh-XAxis\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;color=\u0026lt;axisColor\u0026gt;|major=\u0026lt;tickIncrement\u0026gt;| size=\u0026lt;axisSize\u0026gt;\u0026#34;) \u0026lt;axisColor\u0026gt; (Color) The color of the x-axis. \u0026lt;axisColor\u0026gt; can be expressed as a color constant or an RGB value. \u0026lt;tickIncrement\u0026gt; (Number) Specifies the space between tick marks along the x-axis. A short tick mark will be drawn across the axis every \u0026lt;tickIncrement\u0026gt; units. \u0026lt;axisSize\u0026gt; (Number) The size of the x-axis line itself, in pixels. This value also effects the thickness of the tick marks along the x-axis if they are drawn. This function returns no result.\nNote: The parameter list of the XAxis function includes various name/value pairs of the form name=value. For instance, color=blue is a name/value pair, where the item named color is given the value blue. These various pairs can actually be passed to the function in any order, and all are optional. If color is left out, black is used by default. The default size is two, and if the major parameter is missing, no tick marks will be drawn. The tick labels are optional as well, but if present, they must be at the end of the parameter string, preceeded by the labels keyword. If you don\u0026rsquo;t intend to pass labels, the keyword and list of values can be left out. Function: YAxis The YAxis function controls display of the y-axis on line and bar charts. It allows you to specify the color and thickness of the axis, as well as the placment and labeling of tick marks. It has this syntax:\nExternal(\u0026#34;OzCh-YAxis\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;color=\u0026lt;axisColor\u0026gt;|major=\u0026lt;tickIncrement\u0026gt;| size=\u0026lt;axisSize\u0026gt;\u0026#34;) \u0026lt;axisColor\u0026gt; (Color) The color of the y-axis. \u0026lt;axisColor\u0026gt; can be expressed as a color constant or an RGB value. \u0026lt;tickIncrement\u0026gt; (Number) Specifies the space between tick marks along the y-axis. A short tick mark will be drawn across the axis every \u0026lt;tickIncrement\u0026gt; units. \u0026lt;axisSize\u0026gt; (Number) The size of the y-axis line itself, in pixels. This value also effects the thickness of the tick marks along the y-axis if they are drawn. This function returns no result.\nNote: The parameter list of the YAxis function includes various name/value pairs of the form name=value. For instance, color=blue is a name/value pair, where the item named color is given the value blue. These various pairs can actually be passed to the function in any order, and all are optional. If color is left out, black is used by default. The default size is two, and if the major parameter is missing, no tick marks will be drawn. The tick labels are optional as well, but if present, they must be at the end of the parameter string, preceeded by the labels keyword. If you don\u0026rsquo;t intend to pass labels, the keyword and list of values can be left out. Function: XGrid The XGrid function controls the display of gridlines perpendicular to the x-axis. It allows you to specify the size and color of the lines, and how close together they are drawn. It has this syntax:\nExternal(\u0026#34;OzCh-XGrid\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;color=\u0026lt;gridColor\u0026gt;|major=\u0026lt;increment\u0026gt;|size=\u0026lt;gidSize\u0026gt;\u0026#34;) \u0026lt;axisColor\u0026gt; (Color) The color of the x grid lines. \u0026lt;axisColor\u0026gt; can be expressed as a color constant or an RGB value. \u0026lt;increment\u0026gt; (Number) Specifies the space between x grid lines. \u0026lt;gridSize\u0026gt; (Number) The thickness of the x grid lines, in pixels. Note: If you do not call the XGrid function when generating a chart, no x gridlines will be drawn.\nIf you do not pass a name/value pair for major, the grid lines will automatically be spaced according to the major value for the tick marks of the x-axis.\nFunction: YGrid The YGrid function controls the display of gridlines perpendicular to the y-axis. It allows you to specify the size and color of the lines, and how close together they are drawn. It has this syntax:\nExternal(\u0026#34;OzCh-YGrid\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;color=\u0026lt;gridColor\u0026gt;|major=\u0026lt;increment\u0026gt;|size=\u0026lt;gidSize\u0026gt;\u0026#34;) \u0026lt;axisColor\u0026gt; (Color) The color of the y grid lines. \u0026lt;axisColor\u0026gt; can be expressed as a color constant or an RGB value. \u0026lt;increment\u0026gt; (Number) Specifies the space between y grid lines. \u0026lt;gridSize\u0026gt; (Number) The thickness of the y grid lines, in pixels. Note: If you do not call the YGrid function when generating a chart, no y gridlines will be drawn.\nIf you do not pass a name/value pair for major, the grid lines will automatically be spaced according to the major value for the tick marks of the y-axis.\nFunction: Points This function tells the plugin what points to actually plot. It\u0026rsquo;s syntax varies based on chart type. These points form the content of the chart when drawn. It has this syntax:\n# For Pie charts: External(\u0026#34;OzCh-Points\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026lt;sliceValue\u0026gt;[|\u0026lt;sliceValue]+\u0026#34;) # For Line charts: External(\u0026#34;OzCh-Points\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;linecolor=\u0026lt;lineColor\u0026gt;|Linesize=\u0026lt;lineSize\u0026gt;| pointstyle=\u0026lt;pointStyle\u0026gt;|pointcolor=\u0026lt;pointColor\u0026gt;| \u0026lt;pointXValue\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;PointYValue\u0026gt; [|\u0026lt;pointXValue\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;PointYValue\u0026gt;]+\u0026#34;) # For HBar and VBar charts: External(\u0026#34;OzCh-Points\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026lt;barValue\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;barColor\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;barLabel\u0026gt; [|\u0026lt;barValue\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;barColor\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;barLabel\u0026gt;]+) # For HSBar and VSBar charts: External(\u0026#34;OzCh-Points\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026lt;stackValue\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;stackColor\u0026gt;\u0026#34;) # For Scatter charts: External(\u0026#34;OzCh-Points\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;pointstyle=\u0026lt;pointStyle\u0026gt;| pointcolor=\u0026lt;pointColor\u0026gt;| \u0026lt;pointXValue\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;pointYValue\u0026gt; [|\u0026lt;pointXValue\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;pointYValue\u0026gt;]+\u0026#34;) # For Hilo charts: External(\u0026#34;OzCh-Points\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;linecolor=\u0026lt;hiColor\u0026gt;|linesize=\u0026lt;hiSize\u0026gt;| \u0026lt;xValue\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;hiValue\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;loValue\u0026gt; [\u0026lt;xValue\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;hiValue\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;loValue\u0026gt;]+\u0026#34;) \u0026lt;sliceValue\u0026gt; (Number) The numerical value of one slice of the pie chart. Each slice will be sized based on this value as compared to the total of all \u0026lt;sliceValue\u0026gt;\u0026rsquo;s. You can pass as many values as you like. \u0026lt;lineColor\u0026gt; (Color) The color the line connecting the data points should be. \u0026lt;lineSize\u0026gt; (Number) The thickness in pixels to draw the line connecting data points. \u0026lt;pointStyle\u0026gt; (Constant) The symbol to draw to mark an individual data point. The possible values are: Circlehollow Circlesolid Diamondhollow Diamondsolid Squarehollow Squaresolid Trianglehollow Trianglesolid Crossbig Crosssmall \u0026lt;pointColor\u0026gt; (Color) The color the data point symbol should be drawn in. \u0026lt;pointXValue\u0026gt; (Number) The x-value (position along the horizontal axis) of the data point. \u0026lt;pointYValue\u0026gt; (Number) The y-value (position along the vertical axis) of the data point. \u0026lt;barColor\u0026gt; (Color) The color the bar should be drawn in. \u0026lt;barValue\u0026gt; (Number) The numerical value of the bar. This determines how tall or long the bar is. \u0026lt;barLabel\u0026gt; (Text) An optional label to appear above or to the right of the bar. If this parameter is not specified, no label will be included. \u0026lt;stackValue\u0026gt; (Number) The numerical value of one portion of the bar. It will be drawn to this value starting from the end of the previous portion of this bar. \u0026lt;stackColor\u0026gt; (Color) The color of this portion of the bar. \u0026lt;hiColor\u0026gt; (Color) The color of the High-Low symbol. \u0026lt;hiSize\u0026gt; (Number) The line thickness of the High-Low symbol. \u0026lt;xValue\u0026gt; (Number) Where along the x axis (horizontal axis) the symbol should be drawn. \u0026lt;hiValue\u0026gt; (Number) The top point of the High-Low symbol. \u0026lt;loValue\u0026gt; (Number) The bottom point of the High-Low symbol. Note: In order to chart data with the plugin, you must be able to get the point values into one calculation. If the values span multiple records, you must use some technique to gather them before passing them to the plugin. One method is to step through the records in a looping script, concatenating them in a global field as you go. In general, though, you will be charting summary data, which will usually be accessible all at once more easily.\nIn line and bar chart types, you can plot multiple series of data for comparison. You can call OzCh-Points multiple times to load the various series into the plugin.\nIn the line chart parameters, if you do not specify a \u0026lt;pointStyle\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;pointColor\u0026gt;, the points will not be specifically identified, and just the connecting line will be drawn.\nFunction: Draw This function simply instructs the plugin to draw the chart. With Microsoft Windows 95/98/NT, the chart image will be placed on the clipboard to be pasted into the appropriate field. With Mac OS the chart image will be placed directly into the field, file and record specified in the call to OzCh-Init.

These functions are accessible via the “Define Calculation” dialog box in FileMaker and are thus available in calculation fields and various script steps. See your FileMaker Pro documentation for general information on accessing and using External Functions.\nMost of the functionality provided by these functions can be accomplished without the help of øAzium Strings, but complex string parsing and manipulations often results in long non-intuitive calculations that are hard to understand, hard to debug and include redundancies that inhibit performance. øAzium Strings aims to remedy this by facilitating clear, concise and fast string parsing calculations. As an example, if you have a field called URL which contains a Web Companion URL such as this:\nhttp://www.mydomain.com/FMPro?-db=test.fp3\u0026amp;-lay=web\u0026amp;-format=response.htm\u0026amp;-view And you would like to determine the database name referenced in the URL, with FileMaker’s built in calculation options you have your work cut out for you. The following calculation will accomplish the task:\nMiddle( URL, Position(URL, \u0026#34;-db=\u0026#34;, 0, 1) + 4, Position(URL, \u0026#34;\u0026amp;\u0026#34;, Position(URL, \u0026#34;-db=\u0026#34;, 0, 1), 1) - (Position(URL, \u0026#34;-db=\u0026#34;, 0, 1) + 4) ) Not only is this calculation somewhat long and complex (although it is mild in comparison to some), it is also very hard to determine at a glance what it is doing. If you later want to revise it to find the layout name (after -lay=), not only do you have to find and change every mention of -db= to -lay= (there are 3 of them) but you also must change in two places the addition of 4 to an addition of 5 or you will not get the correct results.\nUsing øAzium Strings (and specifically the provided WStr-Between external function) the exact same results can be obtained from the following calculation:\nExternal(\u0026#34;WStr-Between\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;-db=|\u0026amp;|\u0026#34; \u0026amp; URL) Once you are familiar with the øAzium Strings this calculation is easy to understand (it returns everything in URL between -db= and \u0026amp;), and better yet, if you want to change it to return the layout name, you simply change the starting search string from -db= to -lay=. You do not have to absorb a complex calculation to make simple changes. Despite the overhead inherent to external function calls, this calculation is only slightly slower than the native FileMaker Pro calculation both because it is highly optimized to perform one task and because the redundancy in the first calculation (finding -db= 3 times for instance) is eliminated. The performance difference will diminish (and may even reverse) as the complexity of the calculation increases.\nRequirements øAzium Strings is a FileMaker Pro plugin and consequently requires FileMaker Pro 4.0 or later or FileMaker Pro Developer Edition 4.0 or later. It is available for Microsoft Windows and Macintosh and will run properly on any operating system version and hardware that is supported by FileMaker Pro.\nNote: Unlike FileMaker Pro data files, Plugins are not inherently cross platform. Different versions of the plugin are required for Macintosh and Windows. The Macintosh version, however, is Fat-Binary, meaning will run natively on both PowerPC and older Motorola MC680x0 based Macintosh hardware. License Availability øAzium Strings is available under three licenses. The most common “General Use” license grants the purchaser the right to install and use øAzium Strings for personal use only. If you intend to use øAzium Strings for a large installation (for instance in a business setting where a FileMaker Pro solution will be networked and accessed by several clients) a site license is available. Finally, if you are a commercial solution developer and would like to include øAzium Strings in a commercial product distribution, licensing options are available. Contact Waves In Motion (http://www.wmotion.com) for more details.\nGeneral Overview The External Functions provided by øAzium Strings have a great deal in common with one another. This section covers the general guidelines for using these functions.\nPassing Parameters Each external function supplied by øAzium Strings will take a series of zero or more parameters and return a single text result. A parameter is a single value that you supply to a function when you call it in a calculation. Parameters can be static text you type directly into the calculation definition within quotes:\nExternal(\u0026#34;WStr-ConsiderCase\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Yes\u0026#34;) A field value dynamically entered during evaluation:\nExternal(\u0026#34;WStr-EscapeForParam\u0026#34;, A Text Field) Or a combination of the two:\nExternal(\u0026#34;WStr-EscapeForParam\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Value: \u0026#34; \u0026amp; A Text Field) FileMaker Pro allows for External Functions to have only one parameter which is always a text string. Some functions in øAzium Strings require more than one parameter. When this is the case, the øAzium Strings parameters are concatenated, each separated by a “pipe” or absolute value bar — |, and passed as a single string.\nNote: The | character is generally entered by holding down Shift and typing \\. The back slash key is usually above the return or enter key or to the right or left of the space bar. Your keyboard may vary, but all keyboards can type this key. If you are having trouble finding this key, look closely at your keyboard. It sometimes looks like a straight vertical line, and sometimes like two vertical lines, one directly above the other. It’s bound to be there somewhere. Because the pipe key is used for a special purpose, if you are passing a parameter that itself contains this character, you will confuse the function. To avoid this, all functions support the notion of “escaping” (you may be familiar with this if you are a programmer or an AppleScripter). Any special character that you don’t want to be treated as such can be preceded by a backslash (). This will tell the function to treat the character that immediately follows it as plain text and as part of the parameter rather than interpreting its special meaning. Some functions have other special characters you should be aware of as well (see the individual function explanations later in this manual).\nTip: A function is provided specifically to help with this problem. See the description of the WStr-EscapeForParam function for more information. Non-Text Values as Parameters Because parameters are combined into a single text string, all parameters must be text. FileMaker will generally handle the conversion for you, but if you are using field values in your parameters, and the field(s) are date or time type fields, you will need to explicitly cast the value to text. FileMaker Pro provides built in functions to do this (for example, TimeToText() will cast a time field value to text). Numbers will generally be cast correctly automatically, but it certainly won’t hurt to explicitly cast them as well.\nWarning: Container field values cannot be used with any of the External Functions. Invalid Parameter Strings Every External Function has a clearly defined set of parameters it expects. If you pass too many or too few parameters to a function, the function will simply return no result. Also, each parameter is expected to be of a certain type. See chapter 5, External Function Reference, for an explanation of parameter types.\nGetting the Result When a function is called, it will gather it’s parameters, perform the necessary operation and return a result. The result will be a text string. Essentially, FileMaker Pro will replace the function call in a calculation with the result once it is evaluated:\nExternal(\u0026#34;WStr-Before\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;is|\u0026#34; \u0026amp; External(\u0026#34;WStr-EscapeForParam\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;This|is|a|Test\u0026#34;)) …Becomes…\nExternal(\u0026#34;WStr-Before\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;is|\u0026#34; \u0026amp; \u0026#34;This\\|is\\|a\\|Test\u0026#34;) …Becomes…\n\u0026#34;This|\u0026#34; This allows you to perform multiple function calls in one calculation, and even use function calls as parameters to other function calls. There is no limit to the number of calls or the depth of nesting in a calculation.\nTip: As with parameters, results will always be text. If you expect a time or date result, you will want to explicitly cast the text value to that type to avoid unexpected results. FileMaker Pro also provides built in functions to do this, such as TextToTime(). Generally FileMaker will convert to numbers where necessary automatically, but, again, it won’t hurt to do so explicitly. External Function Overview The øAzium Strings plugin includes 8 external functions in all. One function is a static function. Static functions require no parameters and always return the same value. One is a control function. These functions return no result but control the state of the plugin and effect the behavior of other functions. The remaining 6 are standard functions, directly involved in string manipulations and parsing. They take parameters, use them and return a relevant result. The eight functions are explained briefly below.\nWStr-GetPluginVersion : This static function does not require any parameters. It simply returns the version of the plugin currently installed as a decimal number.\nWStr-GetItemWithDelim : This standard function takes three parameters. It is used to extract text items from lists. A use might be to get file or folder/directory names from a file path or to get an item from a return delimited list.\nWStr-FormatString : This standard function takes two parameters. It is used to format strings (usually of numbers) to match a given pattern. A use might be to format telephone numbers in a contact manager.\nWStr-Before : This standard function takes two parameters. It is used to return the text in a string that comes before a given match string. A use might be to get the protocol of a given URL.\nWStr-After : This standard function takes two parameters. It is used to return the text in a string that comes after a given match string. A use might be to get the domain name from a URL.\nWStr-Between : This standard function takes three parameters. It is used return the text in a string that comes between two given match strings. A use might be to extract values from an Email header.\nWStr-ConsiderCase : This control function takes one parameter. It is used to turn case sensitivity on or off for other functions. It does not return a result.\nWStr-EscapeForParam : This standard function takes one parameter. It is used to prepare a string to be passed as a single parameter in any other String Function without confusing the function. It will “escape” any special characters so that they are interpreted as plain text.\nExternal Function Reference Each External Function expects certain parameters in a certain order. A parameter can be any of these types:\nCharacter: A single letter, number, punctuation mark etc String: A string of characters, like the value of a text field Integer: A whole number. Any decimal points or non-numerical characters will be ignored Flag: Any of a predefined set of values. Appropriate values will be specified under each relevant function For each of the eight functions, the exact syntax, an explanation of the parameters, an explanation of the result and usage examples is given below.\nFunction WStr-GetPluginVersion This static function does not require any parameters. It simply returns the version of the plugin currently installed, as a string. It has this syntax:\nExternal(\u0026#34;WStr-GetPluginVersion\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026#34;) Example: checking if the plug-in is installed and enabled… This calculation will return OK if it is executed when øAzium Strings 1.0 or later is installed. It will return Error if øAzium Strings is not installed or if it is a version prior to 1.0.\nIf ( External(\u0026#34;WStr-GetPluginVersion\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026#34;) \u0026gt;= 1.0, \u0026#34;OK\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Error\u0026#34; ) Function WStr-GetItemWithDelim This standard function takes three parameters. It is used to extract text items from lists. A use might be to get file or folder names from a file path or to get an item from a return delimited list. It has this syntax:\nExternal(\u0026#34;WStr-GetItemWithDelim\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026lt;itemNum\u0026gt;|\u0026lt;delimiter\u0026gt;|\u0026lt;list\u0026gt;\u0026#34;) \u0026lt;itemNum\u0026gt; (Integer) The item number to return. If the item number is positive, the function will count from the beginning of the list and return the \u0026lt;itemNum\u0026gt; item. If \u0026lt;itemNum\u0026gt; is negative, the function will count backward from the end of the list and return the \u0026lt;itemNum\u0026gt; item from the end. \u0026lt;delimiter\u0026gt; (Character) The delimiter to assume when identifying items. The delimiter must be a single character. If you use a value that is not the delimiter of the list, the function will work but you will get unexpected results. \u0026lt;list\u0026gt; (String) The list to search in. The list should be of text items (strings), each separated by a single character delimiter. Specifically, it returns item number \u0026lt;itemNum\u0026gt; in \u0026lt;list\u0026gt; when using \u0026lt;delimiter\u0026gt; as a delimiter. If there are fewer than \u0026lt;itemNum\u0026gt; items in the list, the result will be empty.\nNote: This function involves comparing strings and characters. For information on case sensitivity (whether or not capital and lower case letters are considered the same) see the explanation of the WStr-ConsiderCase External Function. Example: Get an item from a list… Given the following list of colors in a field called List:\nRed Orange Yellow Green Blue Violet You can get these results:\nExternal(\u0026#34;WStr-GetItemWithDelim\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;2|¶|\u0026#34; \u0026amp; List) # returns Orange External(\u0026#34;WStr-GetItemWithDelim\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;-3|¶|\u0026#34; \u0026amp; List) # returns Green (note the negative item number) Example: Parse a DOS file path… Given DOS path c:\\myfiles\\letters\\mom\\jan1.doc in a field called Path, you can get these results:\nExternal(\u0026#34;WStr-GetItemWithDelim\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;1|\\\\|\u0026#34; \u0026amp; Path) # returns the drive letter c: External(\u0026#34;WStr-GetItemWithDelim\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;-1|\\\\|\u0026#34; \u0026amp; Path) # returns the file name jan1.doc Note: In this example, a double backslash (\\) is passed as the delimiter parameter. This is because backslash is a special character and must be escaped. See the explanation of WStr-EscapeForParam for more information. Example: Parse a Macintosh file path… Given the Macintosh path My Hard Disk:Documents:Letters:To Mom:January 1, 1998 in a field called Path, you can get these results:\nExternal(\u0026#34;WStr-GetItemWithDelim\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;1|:|\u0026#34; \u0026amp; Path) # returns the volume name My Hard Disk External(\u0026#34;WStr-GetItemWithDelim\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;-1|:|\u0026#34; \u0026amp; Path) # returns the file name January 1, 1998 Example: Extracting items from value lists… WStr-GetItemWithDelim can be combined with the FileMaker Pro built-in Design Function ValueListItems() to extract certain items from a value list. Suppose you have a value list called \u0026ldquo;Payment Methods\u0026rdquo; with these items:\nCash Check Visa Master Card Discover Then you can get these results:\nExternal(\u0026#34;WStr-GetItemWithDelim\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;3|¶|\u0026#34; \u0026amp; ValueListItems (mydb.fp3, Payment Methods) # returns Visa A looping script could be used to examine all values in a list in succession. As mentioned above, the function will return an empty string (\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) when the item number requested does not exist, signaling the end of the value list.\nFunction WStr-FormatString This standard function takes two parameters. It is used to format strings (usually of numbers) to match a given pattern. A use might be to format telephone numbers in a contact manager. It has this syntax:\nExternal(\u0026#34;WStr-FormatString\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pattern\u0026gt;|\u0026lt;string\u0026gt;\u0026#34;) \u0026lt;pattern\u0026gt; (String) The pattern to apply. The pattern can contain letters, numbers and punctuation, as well as place holders: # place holder for a number (0-9) @ place holder for a letter (a-z or A-Z) * place holder for a letter or a number \u0026lt;string\u0026gt; (String) The string of text to apply the pattern to. The pattern is made up of literals and place holders. Literals (letters, numbers and punctuation) are copied to the result intact. Place holders are substituted with letters and/or numbers from the \u0026lt;string\u0026gt; parameter. If the end oif the \u0026lt;string\u0026gt; parameter to is reached, copying is halted and the result is returned as is. If there are more letters or numbers than the pattern expects, they are ignored. All punctuation and special characters from the \u0026lt;string\u0026gt; pattern are ignored.\nExample: Format a phone number… Given a field called Phone and the calculation:\nExternal(\u0026#34;WStr-FormatString\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;(###) ###-#### x####|\u0026#34; \u0026amp; Phone) The following results will be obtained:\n5555551212 =\u0026gt; (555) 555-1212 555-555-1212 =\u0026gt; (555) 555-1212 5555551212 21 =\u0026gt; (555) 555-1212 x21 0123456789012345 =\u0026gt; (012) 345-6789 x0123 800SOSAPPL =\u0026gt; (800) If the calculation were updated to read:\nExternal(\u0026#34;WStr-FormatString\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;1-###-***-****|\u0026#34; \u0026amp; Phone) Then:\n800SOSAPPL =\u0026gt; 1-800-SOS-APPL Example: Format a social security number… Given a field called Social containing 555-55-5555:\nExternal(\u0026#34;WStr-FormatString\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;SSN: ### ## ####|\u0026#34; \u0026amp; Social # returns 555 55 5555 Example: Extract numbers from a street address… Given a field called Street Address containing 1234 East Third Street:\nExternal(\u0026#34;WStr-FormatString\u0026#34;, \u0026#39;##########|\u0026#34; \u0026amp; Street Address) # returns 1234 Warning: The \u0026lt;pattern\u0026gt; parameter contains special characters (@, #, *). If you want to include these characters as text in the parameter (rather than as place holders) they must be escaped. This function: External(\u0026quot;WStr-FormatString\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;SS#: ###-##-####|\u0026quot; \u0026amp; Social) would return SS5: 555-55-555 which is probably not what you intend. To fix this see the WStr-EscapeForParam function. Function WStr-Before This standard function takes two parameters. It is used to return the text in a string that comes before a given match string. A use might be to get the protocol of a given URL. It has this syntax:\nExternal(\u0026#34;WStr-Before\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026lt;match\u0026gt;|\u0026lt;string\u0026gt;\u0026#34;) \u0026lt;match\u0026gt; (String) The string of text to end before \u0026lt;string\u0026gt; (String) The string of text to search in Specifically, this function returns the text in \u0026lt;string\u0026gt; before the first occurrence of \u0026lt;match\u0026gt;. If \u0026lt;match\u0026gt; is not found in \u0026lt;string\u0026gt; nothing will be returned. The result will not end with \u0026lt;match\u0026gt;.\nNote: This function involves comparing strings and characters. For information on case sensitivity (whether or not capital and lower case letters are considered the same) see the explanation of the WStr-ConsiderCase External Function. Example: Get the protocol moniker from a URL… Given http://www.microsoft.com/ in a field called URL.\nExternal(\u0026#34;WStr-Before\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;:|\u0026#34; \u0026amp; URL) Would return http. If URL contained ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/ the same calculation would return ftp.\nExample: Get the first paragraph from a block of text… Given a field called Letter Body containing the body of a letter, this formula would return the first paragraph of the letter:\nExternal(\u0026#34;WStr-Before\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;¶|\u0026#34; \u0026amp; Letter Body) Function WStr-After This standard function takes two parameters. It is used to return the text in a string that comes after a given match string. A use might be to get the domain name from a URL. It has this syntax:\nExternal(\u0026#34;WStr\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026lt;match\u0026gt;|\u0026lt;string\u0026gt;\u0026#34;) \u0026lt;match\u0026gt; (String) The string of text to start after \u0026lt;string\u0026gt; (String) The string of text to search in Specifically this function returns the text in \u0026lt;string\u0026gt; before the first occurrence of \u0026lt;match\u0026gt;. If \u0026lt;match\u0026gt; is not found in \u0026lt;string\u0026gt; nothing will be returned. The result will not begin with \u0026lt;match\u0026gt;.\nNote: This function involves comparing strings and characters. For information on case sensitivity (whether or not capital and lower case letters are considered the same) see the explanation of the WStr-ConsiderCase External Function. Example: Get the hostname from a URL Given a field called URL containing http://www.apple.com/:\nExternal(\u0026#34;WStr-After\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;://|\u0026#34; \u0026amp; URL) Would return www.apple.com/.\nFunction WStr-Between This standard function takes three parameters. It is used return the text in a string that comes between two given match strings. A use might be to extract values from an Email header. It has this syntax:\nExternal(\u0026#34;WStr-Between\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026lt;match1\u0026gt;|\u0026lt;match2\u0026gt;|\u0026lt;string\u0026gt;\u0026#34;) \u0026lt;match1\u0026gt; (String) The string of text to start after \u0026lt;match2\u0026gt; (String) The string of text to begin before \u0026lt;string\u0026gt; (String) The string of text to search in The text within \u0026lt;string\u0026gt; which comes between \u0026lt;match1\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;match2\u0026gt;. If either \u0026lt;match1\u0026gt; or \u0026lt;match2\u0026gt; is not found in \u0026lt;string\u0026gt; nothing will be returned. The result will neither begin with \u0026lt;match1\u0026gt; nor end with \u0026lt;match2\u0026gt;.\nNote: This function involves comparing strings and characters. For information on case sensitivity (whether or not capital and lower case letters are considered the same) see the explanation of the WStr-ConsiderCase External Function. Example: Parsing a CDML URL… Given a field called URL containing:\nhttp://www.yourdomain.com/FMPro?-db=mydb.fp3\u0026amp;-lay=web\u0026amp;-format=response.htm\u0026amp;-view You can easily obtain these results:\nExternal(\u0026#34;WStr-Between\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;://|/|\u0026#34; \u0026amp; URL) # returns www.yourdomain.com External(\u0026#34;WStr-Between\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;-db=|\u0026amp;|\u0026#34; \u0026amp; URL) # returns mydb.fp3 External(\u0026#34;WStr-Between\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;-lay=|\u0026amp;|\u0026#34; \u0026amp; URL) # returns web External(\u0026#34;WStr-Between\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;-format=|\u0026amp;|\u0026#34; \u0026amp; URL) # returns response.htm Example: Parsing SMTP email headers… Given a field called Header containing an SMTP Email header:\nExternal(\u0026#34;WStr-Between\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;subject:|¶|\u0026#34; \u0026amp; Header) Would return the subject of the message.\nFunction WStr-ConsiderCase This control function takes one parameter. It is used to turn case sensitivity on or off for the following functions:\nWStr-GetItemWithDelim WStr-Before WStr-After WStr-Between It has this syntax:\nExternal(\u0026#34;WStr-ConsiderCase\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026lt;option\u0026gt;\u0026#34;) \u0026lt;options\u0026gt; (Flag) The setting for case sensitivity. \u0026lt;option\u0026gt; itself is never case sensitive (YeS will work as well as yes). \u0026lt;option\u0026gt; can be Yes, Y or 1 to turn case sensitivity on; No, N or 0 (zero) to turn case sensitivity off. This function has no result.\nNote: When case sensitivity is turned on (Yes, Y, 1) it will remain on until it is turned off, the plugin is re-enabled (via Edit → Preferences → Application under Plugins in FileMaker Pro) or FileMaker Pro is relaunched. The change will effect all references to the effected functions in all files. Case sensitivity is always off when the plugin first loads. Warning: If you are going to mix multiple files using øAzium Strings, shipping a commercial product which uses øAzium Strings or use files you did not create, it is recommended that you always set case sensitivity using WStr-ConsiderCase. If you do not, calculations which work in testing may fail in use. Note: FileMaker Pro can only execute one script at a time or evaluate one calculation at a time. Bearing this in mind, it is safe to set case sensitivity at the top of a script and assume that setting throughout that script and it’s subscripts. Also, if a calculation contains multiple calls to effected functions, case sensitivity needs to be set only once in the calculation. See the examples below for how to enable case sensitivity within calculations. Example: Parsing a URL without worrying about case… Given a field called URL containing http://www.yourdomain.com/FMPro?-DB=mydb.fp3\u0026amp;-LAY=web\u0026amp;-FORMAT=response.htm\u0026amp;-view, the calculation:\nExternal(\u0026#34;WStr-Between\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;-db=|\u0026amp;\u0026#34;| \u0026amp; URL) Will return mydb.fp3 if case sensitivity is off, but will not return a result if case sensitivity is on, since -db= is not in the URL. To avoid this problem, set case sensitivity in the calculation:\nExternal(WStr-ConsiderCase\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;n\u0026#34;) \u0026amp; External(\u0026#34;WStr-Between\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;-db=|\u0026amp;\u0026#34; \u0026amp; URL) This will return the correct result always.\nTip: Since WStr-ConsiderCase returns no result it can be mixed into your calculation anywhere and will not effect the value of the calculation after evaluation. Example: Setting case sensitivity in a script… If you are using several effected functions in a multi-step ScriptMaker™ script, you can insert the following step at the top of your script:\nSet Field [ field name, External(\u0026#34;WStr-ConsiderCase)\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;No\u0026#34;) ] Now all function calls in steps following this one will have case sensitivity turned off. It makes no difference what field is the target of this set field step, but bear in mind that it will empty the field (\u0026quot;\u0026quot;). You can turn case sensitivity off and on as often as you want, even mixing modes within a single calculation or script. Although you will not effect the value of a field if you set it to itself and a WStr-ConsiderCase call, if that field is later deleted it will have adverse effects on seemingly unrelated scripts. For this reason, it is recommended that you create a global field in each file to be the target of this and other control functions.\nWarning: You may be tempted to try not specifying a field in the set field step. This will not work as FileMaker considers the step invalid, generates an error (102: Field Missing) and does not evaluate the calculation. Function WStr-EscapeForParam This standard function takes one parameter. It is used to prepare a string to be passed as a single parameter in any other String Function without confusing the function. Essentially it will “escape” any special characters so that they are interpreted as plain text. It has this syntax:\nExternal(\u0026#34;WStr-EscapeForParam\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026lt;param\u0026gt;\u0026#34;) \u0026lt;param\u0026gt; (String) The text parameter to prepare. Specifically this function returns with all special characters “escaped”; in other words, all special characters will be preceded by a backslash (). Currently, special characters include:\n\\ Escape character | Parameter delimiter @ Alpha-character place holder # Numeric character place holder * Alpha-numeric character place holder Tip: Generally, if you are using a field value you do not control as a parameter, or part of a parameter, you should pass it through WStr-EscapeForParam to be sure it will not cause problems. This includes fields whose values are entered by users. You can escape static text parameters (parameters you type directly in the calculation definition) manually or by passing it through this function. Note though that future versions of the plugin may add additional special characters, and the WStr-EscapeForParam function will be updated to support any additions. Warning: If you pass the \u0026lt;pattern\u0026gt; parameter of the WStr-FormatString function through this function, the pattern will be invalidated as all place holder characters will be escaped. Example: Work with lists that use | as a delimiter… If you have a field called List which contains Extra Large|Large|Medium|Small|Extra Small, you may be tempted to use the following calculation:\nExternal(\u0026#34;WStr-GetItemWithDelim\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;2|||\u0026#34; \u0026amp; List) But this calculation passes to the function 8 parameters (2, \u0026quot;\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;\u0026quot;, Extra Large, Large, Medium, Small, Extra Small) while the function expects only 3. The function call will fail and will return nothing. To avoid this problem, you must escape the | character in your parameters. First, the \u0026lt;delimiter\u0026gt; parameter needs to be escaped so that | is treated as the value for delimiter and not as a special character (separating parameters). Second, the field List must be treated such that the | characters are escaped, allowing the field value to be treated as one parameter. The following calculation accomplishes both:\nExternal(\u0026#34;WStr-GetItemWithDelim\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;2|\\||\u0026#34; \u0026amp; External(\u0026#34;WStr-EscapeForParam\u0026#34;, List)) This calculation will produce in the correct result — Large. Notice that the second | in the function call is preceded by a backslash. This is a case of escaping the parameter manually in the text of the calculation. Also notice that the field List is passed through WStr-EscapeForParam before being sent to WStr-GetItemWithDelim.\nTroubleshooting If you are having trouble using øAzium Strings, see if you can find the problem below.\nThe plugin gives an error message when I launch FileMaker Pro and refuses to load. Make sure you are using the full version of øAzium Strings. If you are using a Beta or Demonstration version, it will expire after a period of time. If you have not done so already, contact Waves In Motion (http://www.wmotion.com) to purchase the full version.\nThe External Functions do not show in the function list in the calculation dialog box. Like Status and Design Functions, External Functions will not show in the complete list of functions in the top right corner of the calculation dialog box. From the popup above the function list, choose External. The External Functions should now show, organized by plugin.\nMake sure the function is installed and loaded. From the Edit menu, choose Preferences, then Application. Click the Plugins tab or choose Plugins from the popup menu. In the list of plugins, you should see øAzium Strings. Make sure the box next to its name is checked. If øAzium Strings is not in the list, it is not properly installed. Refer to your FileMaker Pro documentation for information on installing plugins.\nIf you do not have a plugins section in your FileMaker preferences, you are not using FileMaker Pro 4.0. Contact FileMaker Inc. for upgrade information.\nI am using an external function in a calculation, but nothing is being returned. Make sure the plugin is installed and loaded (see above). If a calculation references a function that does not exist, it will not return a result. Also, make sure your function call uses the correct spelling and capitalization for the function name. It is easiest to choose the correct function from the function list than to type it in yourself.\nIf the plugin is installed and loaded and the function name is spelled correctly, make sure you are sending the correct number of parameters. If a function receives too many or too few parameters it will not return a result.\nOccasionally there will not be enough memory for the function to work properly. This is uncommon, as the functions use a very small amount of memory, but possible. If you are using a Macintosh, try quitting FileMaker and increasing its memory allocation in the Get Info window. If you are using Windows, it is extremely unlikely that memory is the problem.\nThe External Functions seem to drop some characters. Sometimes I have backslashes in my parameters and they are missing from the results. The External Functions use the backslash character to “escape” special characters. This means that the backslash itself is a special character. If a parameter contains a backslash, it will assume it is escaping the following character and will be skipped. To avoid this problem you must escape the backslash itself by preceding it with a backslash (\\\\). See the explanation of the WStr-EscapeForParam function for more information.\n","img":false,"link":"/archive/forhire/oazium-strings/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"øAzium Strings"},{"content":"This was my first \u0026ldquo;personal\u0026rdquo; site. In 1998 when Isabel was born, I built a small site to share baby photos with family around the country. This of course predates things like Facebook, Instagram, etc… The photos are tiny and low quality because we were all using dialup at the time. This was a fun personal project that gave me a chance to demonstrate to family members what I did for a living.\nThe site was originally hosted at http://coffey.nu/isa. The web server was WebSTAR, an HTTP server for classic Mac OS that supported an AppleScript ACGI interface. Pages were dynamically generated in AppleScript on the server side using data stored in a FileMaker Pro database. Internet hosting was provided by AMUG, the Arizona Macintosh Users Group.\nWhile I could add new photo metadata via the web interface, I had to upload the photos themselves manually using FTP. File upload was added to the HTML spec a year earlier in HTML 3.2, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t yet know how to use it. Instead I ran the Rumpus FTP server for classic Mac OS so I could copy files directly to the server.\nThis archive is a static copy based on the original templates and data. (And as such the admin functions to manage and post photos no longer work.)\nEnter the Site ","img":true,"link":"/archive/site/isa/","tags":["Archive Post"],"title":"Isabel Photosite"},{"content":" About This is one of my favorite entries from Mary MacLane\u0026rsquo;s memoir, I Await the Devil\u0026rsquo;s Coming. You can read about my Mary MacLane Mastodon bot here. February 7. In this house where I drag out my accursed, devilish, weary existence, upstairs in the bathroom, on the little ledge at the top of the wainscoting, there are six tooth-brushes: an ordinary white bone-handled one that is my younger brother’s; a white twisted-handled one that is my sister’s; a flat-handled one that is my older brother’s; a celluloid-handled one that is my stepfather’s; a silver-handled one that is mine; and another ordinary one that is my mother’s. The sight of these tooth-brushes day after day, week after week, and always, is one of the most crushingly maddening circumstances in my fool’s life.\nEvery Friday I wash up the bathroom. Usually I like to do this. I like the feeling of the water squeezing through my fingers, and always it leaves my nails beautifully neat. But the obviousness of those six tooth-brushes signifying me and the five other members of this family and the aimless emptiness of my existence here—Friday after Friday—makes my soul weary and my heart sick.\nNever does the pitiable, barren, contemptible, damnable, narrow Nothingness of my life in this house come upon me with so intense a force as when my eyes happen upon those six tooth-brushes.\nAmong the horrors of the Inquisition, a minute refinement of cruelty was reached when the victim’s head was placed beneath a never-ceasing falling of water, drop by drop.\nA convict sentenced to solitary confinement, spending his endless days staring at four blank walls, feels that had he committed every known crime he could not possibly deserve his punishment.\nI am not undergoing an Inquisition, nor am I a convict in solitary confinement. But I live in a house with people who affect me mostly through their tooth-brushes—and those I should like, above all things, to gather up and pitch out of the bathroom window—and oh, damn them, damn them!\nYou who read this, can you understand the depth of bitterness and hatred that is contained in this for me? Perhaps you can a little if you are a woman and have felt yourself alone. When I look at the six tooth-brushes a fierce, lurid storm of rage and passion comes over me. Two heavy leaden hands lay hold of my life and press, press, press. They strike the sick, sick weariness to my inmost soul.\nOh, to leave this house and these people, and this intense Nothingness—oh, to pass out from them, forever! But where can I go, what can I do? I feel with mad fury that I am helpless. The grasp of the stepfather and the mother is contemptible and absurd—but with the persistence and tenacity of narrow minds. It is like the two heavy leaden hands. It is not seen—it is not tangible. It is felt.\nOnce I took away my own silver-handled tooth-brush from the bathroom ledge, and kept it in my bedroom for a day or two. I thought to lessen the effect of the six.\nI put it back in the bathroom.\nThe absence of one accentuated the significant damnation of the others. There was something more forcibly maddening in the five than in the six tooth-brushes. The damnation was not worse, but it developed my feeling about them more vividly.\nAnd so I put my tooth-brush back in the bathroom.\nThis house is comfortably furnished. My mother spends her life in the adornment of it. The small square rooms are distinctly pretty.\nBut when I look at them seeingly I think of the proverb about the dinner of stalled ox.\nYet there is no hatred here, except mine and my bitterness. I am the only one of them whose bitter spirit cries out against things.\nBut there is that which is subtler and strikes deeper. There is the lack of sympathy—the lack of everything that counts: there is the great, deep Nothing.\nHow much better were there hatred here than Nothing!\nI long hopelessly for will—power, resolution to take my life into my own hands, to walk away from this house some day and never return. I have nowhere to go—no money, and I know the world quite too well to put the slightest faith in its voluntary kindness of heart. But how much better and wider, less damned, less maddening, to go out into it and be beaten and cheated and fooled with, than this!—this thing that gathers itself easily into a circle made of six tooth-brushes with a sufficiency of surplus damnation.\nI have read about a woman who went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among thieves. Perhaps she had a house at Jerusalem with six tooth-brushes and Nothingness. In that case she might have rushed gladly into the arms of thieves.\nI think of crimes that strike horror and revulsion to my maid-senses. And I think of my Nothingness, and I ask myself were it not better to walk the earth an outcast, a solitary woman, and meet and face even these, than that each and every one of my woman-senses should wear slowly, painfully to shreds, and strain and break—in this unnameable Nothing? Oh, the dreariness—the hopelessness of Nothing!\nThere are no words to tell it. And things are always hardest to bear when there are no words for them.\nHowever great one’s gift of language may be, there is always something that one can not tell.\nI am weary of self—always self. But it must be so.\nMy life is filled with self.\nIf my soul could awaken fully perhaps I might be lifted out of myself—surely I should be. But my soul is not awake. It is awakening, trying to open its eyes; and it is crying out blindly after something, but it can not know. I have a dreadful feeling that it will stay always like this.\nOh, I feel everything—everything! I feel what might be. And there is Nothing. There are six tooth-brushes.\nWould I stop for a few fine distinctions, a theory, a natural law even, to escape from this into Happiness—or into something greatly less?\nMisery—misery! If only I could feel it less!\nOh, the weariness, the weariness—as I await the Devil’s coming.\nFootnotes Text lightly edited from the Project Gutenberg version of Mary MacLane\u0026rsquo;s 1902 memoir, I Await the Devil\u0026rsquo;s Coming.
