# Colophon

This site is designed, written, and maintained by <a rel="author" href="/me">*Geoff Coffey*</a>.  It is built using [web standards][w3c] including semantic HTML and CSS. Javascript is used sparingly. **You will find no cookies, tracking codes, or fingerprinting here.** The pages you see are assembled at build-time by the *[Hugo CMS][hugo]* system using a custom theme. The assembled site is fully static and hosted by *[Netflify][netlify]*.

Pages are edited in *[BBEdit][bbedit]* by *Bare Bones Software*. They are primarily authored in *[Markdown][md]* by *John Gruber*. CSS is written in *[Sass][sass]* and compiled by Hugo.

Pre-assembled source code of the site is available on [GitHub][github].

## Design

Pages are typset in the clean and beautiful *[Palatino][palatino]*, designed by *[Hermann Zapf][zapf]* in 1949, and licensed from *[Linotype][linotype]*. This typeface is special to me because it was included on my childhood computer and used for all my personal writing projects early in life.

Menus, code styles, and other non-content metadata are set in *[Courier Round][round]*, a variant of *[Courier][courier]* designed by *[Howard Kettler][kettler]* in 1955 for IBM typewriters. It is also licensed from Linotype.
