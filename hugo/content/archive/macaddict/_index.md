MacAddict, was a magazine targeted at the Macintosh market. For a brief period I thought about transitioning from software engineering to tech journalism. I love to write and always have. I wrote three small articles for MacAddict, and a few articles for some smaller publications. But eventually programming pulled me back in. 

You can find scans of the original MacAddict issues on the [Internet Archive's magazine archive](https://archive.org/details/macaddict).
