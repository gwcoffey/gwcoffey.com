At the end of a very long and stressful week I came home to discover my kids had made me this homemade feast. Seared tuna tacos with pico and sliced radish. Pollo asado tacos with mango chutney and red cabbage. And carnitas tacos with roasted tomato salsa and sliced jalape√±o. 

And when I say "homemade" I mean it:

- Homemade blue corn tortillas
- Two kinds of homemade salsa
- Homemade mango chutney
- Homemade pork shoulder carnitas

I knew they were up to something but I had no idea they were doing this. They spent all morning yesterday while I was away shopping all over Phoenix for the best stuff, and all afternoon today cooking. 

I'm flabbergasted. And also full. Oh and very happy. Thank you poochlets.
