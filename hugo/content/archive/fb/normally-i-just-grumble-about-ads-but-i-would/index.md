Normally I just grumble about ads but I would like to confess that this lady who shows up in the first one second of the Alexa ad Facebook has been showing me constantly for days ... this lady makes me happy. Every time I see her enthusiastic face I feel a little better about the world. And I see it pretty much every time I scroll the Facebook timeline. 

Thank you commercial actor. I'd like to hire you to be enthusiastic about things that happen around me.
