It's not the same thing.

I see so many of my friends making dismissive posts about those who express dismay, fear, or sadness about our new president, or those who protest against his election. The common thread is that this is a democracy, he won, and conservatives felt the same way about Obama, so people should stop complaining.

But it's not the same thing.

If, during the 2008 campaign, Obama had said "White people, they're not the best people. They enslaved us. They rape us. They shoot us down. And some of them, I assume, are good people", you might have a hint of what some people are feeling.

If, during the 2008 campaign, Obama had said "I'm calling for a total and complete shutdown of Christians entering America. Studies show 35% of christians think gays and lesbians should be punished. Without looking at the polls, it is obvious to anyone that their hatred is beyond comprehension. Until we understand where their hate comes from, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Homophobia, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life," you might have a hint of what some people are feeling.

If, during the 2008 campaign, Obama had said, when asked about dealing with Christian citizens, "We're going to have to do certain things that were frankly unthinkable a year ago," you might have a hint of what some people are feeling. 

If, during the 2008 campaign, Obama had said "Radical White Christianity is at the root of the KKK, lynchings, slavery, and attacks against feminism and the LGBTQ community. We need to tell the truth about radical white christianity, and John McCain won't even use the word. What is he afraid of? He hasn't even said he's not a christian." you might have a hint of what some people are feeling.

I say "a hint" because of course Obama would never have been elected if he had said these things. You don't get elected by spewing hate at the ruling class. And until a week ago, it had been 70+ years since someone in this country could be elected by spewing hate so openly at *any* minority group.

And also, of course, we are not as familiar with the language of hate as those who have experienced it first hand, so we're less attuned to it, less impacted by it. Even hearing a president say those things about us wouldn't be as frightening to us, because we don't fear that those words will become actions. Perhaps in Trump's case they won't but it is ridiculous to dismiss concerns by some groups that they may.

When you suggest that people who respond negatively to these kinds of words used by a president against their own communities are whining, you imply that the only difference between Donald Trump and, say, Barack Obama is substantive policy disagreements. Buried in that is the assumption that Trump's racism doesn't matter. And that is why it is accurate to say you are "normalizing" racism and bigotry. You're saying racism isn't really important and when people act like it is their response is invalid. 

You may despise Obama. That's your prerogative. But he never gave you any legitimate reason to think he despises you, or people like you. That's a terribly important distinction.

Have a little heart for the girls who were told by their president that all they are is "a piece of ass".

Have a little heart for the immigrants who were told by their president that they are ruining our country, and that they are not a great kind of people.

Have a little heart for the muslims who were told by their president that people who share their religion are unfit to even enter the country

Have a little heart for those with disabilities who were bullied and made fun of from the pulpit by their president because they struggle with language or motor control.

Have a little heart for the victims of sexual abuse who had to listen to their president laugh about how he can "grab them by the pussy" any time he wants because he's rich and powerful.

Have a little heart for the POWs and their families who were told by their president that only losers get captured.

Have a little heart for the protesters who, in the face of all this, when they chose to express their distaste for his behavior, were told that they are "professional protesters incited by the media" and that their protest is "unfair!" by the most powerful man in the world. 

Have a little heart for the parents who don't love the idea of a president who brags about the size of his penis in public, and threatens to sodomize those who disagree with him.

Have a little heart. I only ask that you have a little bit. Just enough to understand where your neighbors are coming from. You don't have to agree with them, but if you can't even bring yourself to understand their concern, then shame on you.

There are lots of reasons people voted for Donald Trump. It is wrong to suggest that everyone who voted for him is a racist or a bigot. But it is not wrong to point out that by voting for him, we decided his overt racism didn't matter enough to disqualify him. It is obvious and expected that the communities who were a target of his hate speech would be upset by that result. 

Be happy that Trump was elected. Be happy that your policy preferences may see increased acceptance in government. Be happy that your man won the election. But have just a shred of empathy to realize that the other half of Donald Trump, the half so many of us were opposed to, is just as real, and that half is a hateful, foul mouthed man who used divisive language to rally support from some of the darkest corners of our country. Have enough empathy to understand why the targets of that speech have legitimate concerns. You don't have to hate your neighbor to appreciate your president.
