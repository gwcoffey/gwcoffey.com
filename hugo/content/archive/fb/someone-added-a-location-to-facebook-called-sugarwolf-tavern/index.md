Someone added a location to Facebook called "Sugarwolf Tavern" but they marked it as a "Region" at the longitude and latitude of my front yard. Now every single time I post a picture in my house it bugs me about tagging it as Sugarwolf Tavern. I need a block button for locations. I promise there's not a tavern on my driveway.
