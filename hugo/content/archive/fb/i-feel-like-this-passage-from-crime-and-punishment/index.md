I feel like this passage from Crime and Punishment says more about politics than about romance. 

{{< quote cite="from Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky" >}}
There’s nothing in the world more difficult than candor, and nothing easier than flattery. If there is only the hundredth part of a false note in candor, there is immediately a dissonance, and then—scandal. But with flattery, even if everything is false down to the last little note, it is still agreeable and is listened to not without pleasure; crude though the pleasure may be, it is still a pleasure. And however crude the flattery may be, at least half of it is sure to seem true.
