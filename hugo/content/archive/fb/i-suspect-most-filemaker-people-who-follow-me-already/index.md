I suspect most FileMaker people who follow me already know Don Levan, but in case you don't, let me say that he combines deeply reasoned understanding of user interaction and design with a soft-spoken and insightful style that is always refreshing and inspiring.

He is respected by everyone I know and I'm sure he is putting together a very worthwhile conference. If you are interested in learning with the best, this would be well worth your time. And you couldn't ask for a more delightful setting than Autumn in Chicago. Check it outâ€¦
