Sophia: If I ever get married I don’t want you to “give me away.”

Me: Ok.

Sophia: You don’t own me. 

Me: Indeed. 

Sophia: That’s just celebrating the patriarchy. 

Me: Ok. 

Sophia: Would you be mad if I didn’t want you to give me away?

Me: No. 

Sophia: Would you be mad if I wanted you to give me away?

Me: No. 

Sophia: Good. 

[45 second pass]

Sophia: You can still come to my wedding though. ... ... If you want.
