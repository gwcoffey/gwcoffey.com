Sometimes it feels like the whole world has regressed 50 years in the last two weeks but wile it is little consolation I like to remember that the new Alexander Hamilton is still Puerto Rican, the new George Washington is still black, the new Luke Skywalker is still a girl, the new Sulu is still gay, and several recent Disney princesses still need no prince to be whole.
