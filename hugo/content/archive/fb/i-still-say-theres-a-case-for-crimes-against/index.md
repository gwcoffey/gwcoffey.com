I still say there's a case for crimes against humanity here, all up and down the chain. Just absolutely disgusting. One of the greatest evils perpetrated by the US government in history.

"I asked the current Administration official whether the outcry over family separation had caught the government by surprise. It had, the official said.

'The expectation was that the kids would go to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, that the parents would get deported, and that no one would care.'

Yet, when it became clear that the public did, the Administration chose not to change course."
