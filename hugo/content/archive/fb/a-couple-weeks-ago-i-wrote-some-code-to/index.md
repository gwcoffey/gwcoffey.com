A couple weeks ago I wrote some code to delete all my twitter activity that is more than 30 days old and I’ve been running it periodically. 

I’m considering doing the same thing with Facebook. On twitter this doesn’t negatively impact the experience at all and it keeps me from leaving a trail behind. It’ll be a little more invasive on Facebook where things like photo albums and notifications about old posts are sometimes fun. So maybe I’ll regret it.

I’m curious what other people think.

How much value is there in social media being more than a transient “current” stream of interactions?
