At the risk of sounding self-congratulatory let me go on the record and say I'm a man, I've been in a lot of locker rooms, and I've never ever spoken about women that way. Please don't normalize this.

It may not be entirely uncommon for men to deconstruct women into sexual play things and brag about assaulting them but that's exactly the point: it should be. #ImWithHer
