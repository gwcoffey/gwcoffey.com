An old Michael Silverblatt interview in which (among other things) Art Spiegelman seems to argue that reality tv is the opposite of literature in the sense that reality tv argues that reality is just stories, and literature argues that stories are real.

Also, let it be said that Daniel Handler is one of my favorite author interviewees.
