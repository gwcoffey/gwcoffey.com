{{< figure src="20180315_105133.jpg" caption="The Stele of Democracy, originally displayed before the Areopagos, declaring the law against tyranny, passed by the Athenians in 337 BC:\n“If any should rise up against the People in tyranny or join in establishing tyranny or overthrow the People of the Athenians or the democracy in Athens, whoever kills him who does any of these things shall be blameless.\n“It shall not be permitted for any member of the Councillors of the Council from the Court — the People or the democracy in Athens having been overthrown — to go up into the Court or sit in the Council or deliberate on any topic. If any one of the Councillors of the Court — the People or the democracy in Athens having been overthrown — goes up into the Court or sits in the Council or deliberates on any topic, both he and his progeny shall be deprived of civil rights and his substance shall be confiscated and a tenth given to the Goddess.”\nThe image above the text depicts a personified Democracy crowning “Demos”, The People, with authority." >}}
