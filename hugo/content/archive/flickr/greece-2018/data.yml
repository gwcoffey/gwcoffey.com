The rest are casts of the originals which were looted during ottoman rule (mostly by the British) and never returned. There is a spot in the display for every panel, with the original when available, a cast when the original is elsewhere, and an empty space where the original is lost or not yet found."

    caption: "One tiny slice of the beautiful mess of Athens seen from Mars Hill. I believe that patch on the mountain side is a Pentelic marble quarry. You can see several of them in the mountains all around if you look closely. Sometimes it seems like with all the massive structures around made of solid marble that Athens would run out. Then you see these and you realize there‚Äôs a lot of rock in those mountains. Thousands of years of quarries just look like little spots here and there."

    caption: "The Stele of Democracy, originally displayed before the Areopagos, declaring the law against tyranny, passed by the Athenians in 337 BC:\n\n‚ÄúIf any should rise up against the People in tyranny or join in establishing tyranny or overthrow the People of the Athenians or the democracy in Athens, whoever kills him who does any of these things shall be blameless.\n\n‚ÄúIt shall not be permitted for any member of the Councillors of the Council from the Court ‚Äî the People or the democracy in Athens having been overthrown ‚Äî to go up into the Court or sit in the Council or deliberate on any topic. If any one of the Councillors of the Court ‚Äî the People or the democracy in Athens having been overthrown ‚Äî goes up into the Court or sits in the Council or deliberates on any topic, both he and his progeny shall be deprived of civil rights and his substance shall be confiscated and a tenth given to the Goddess.‚Äù\n\nThe image above the text depicts a personified Democracy crowning ‚ÄúDemos‚Äù, The People, with authority."
