   {{< listapp/item title="I've always had the sense that maybe my perception is broken." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Like sometimes people talk about how beautiful some instrumental music is..." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="And I kind of think asking which of two noises is prettier..." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Is like asking which of two colors tastes better." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="It's sound right? I mean I can tell when something is grating and awful but above that threshold it's all kind of an ambiguous mash of \"sure sounds fine I guess.\""
      desc="Aside: Songs with words sung by human voices are an entirely different story..." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I think maybe I just learned what people think sounds pretty well enough that I can guess at it reliably enough to avoid notice." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I was thinking about this today and it reminded me that when I was a kid I couldn't really figure out what made one person \"beautiful\" and not another." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Someone would say \"she's so hot\" and I'd look and try to figure out why they said that about this person in particular." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I remember looking at eyes, mouths, hair, chins in photographs looking for clues to this thing called pretty." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="And I knew that the celebrity women I felt most enthralled by as a teen were not the ones everybody branded as particularly beautiful." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Like Joan Cusack and Juliet Lewis and Laura Dern."
      desc="So I usually kept these opinions to myself." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="This all came to head when I was a freshman in high school." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="For some reason there was a picture of a woman in a swimsuit projected on the pull down screen." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="And for some reason this guy in my class said aloud to me, \"do you think she's hot?\"" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I can't for the life of me remember how all this came to pass." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="But I remember sitting there believing everyone in the class was waiting for my answer." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="And I had no idea what the right answer was." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Do I say she's pretty and then maybe she's not and everyone laughs at me?" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Or do I say she's not and she is and all the guys call me \"gay\" (that's how things were in the 80s; sorry...)" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I stared at that picture trying to find some clue. Is she pretty? Or more correctly, does she have the requisite look, proportion, accoutrements, or whatever to make everyone else think she's pretty?" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="It felt like too much time was passing." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I had to answer quickly." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="And then suddenly it seemed obvious. She was in this obviously professional photograph." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="In a swim suit." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="On a boat." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="In the blue water." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Whoever arranged this shot would have chosen someone pretty." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="It seemed like a safe bet." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="So I said yes." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="And that was the right answer. Or anyway it didn't cause any laughter." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="As time went on I got better at discerning what people think is beautiful and I also started caring less about agreeing with them." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="So I hadn't really thought about it for years." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Is this weird or did everyone feel this way?" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I have no idea." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Maybe beauty is a social act." >}}
