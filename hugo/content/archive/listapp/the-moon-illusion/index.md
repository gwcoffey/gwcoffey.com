This finally makes sense to me.

Then later in the night when the moon is high and tiny, do it again. It will be the same size in relation to your thumb even though it looks tiny up there." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="We have no real bearing to comprehend the size and shape of the sky. It is just big and largely empty. It is hard to tell what is close and what is far away because the things in the sky aren't things we interact with."

   {{< listapp/item title="The one thing we do have a decent intuitive sense of is clouds." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="We see them in the sky all the time. We may not have a clear sense of their absolute size, but we do know this:" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="When they're right over head they look big. As they recede to the horizon they appear smaller and smaller."
      image="13.jpg" >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="This fits our intuitive sense of the world. Everything we see looks smaller when it is farther away."
      desc="So it's a convincing model of the sky." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="And it fits factual reality. Clouds are around 100 times further away from us on the horizon vs directly overhead."
      desc="They aren't very high up." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="And their apparent size is correspondingly smaller." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="This gives us an intuitive sense of the sky, of how things behave in the sky, even though we aren't good at guessing exactly how far away objects in the sky actually are." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="And there's the rub..." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="The Moon high in the sky is, for all practical purposes, no closer than the moon on the horizon."
      desc="Because the moon is very very very high up." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="So the actual apparent size of the moon does *not* get smaller as it approaches the horizon." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="But our sense of the sky makes us think it *should*. Just like clouds and airplanes and hot air balloons and everything else we see in the sky." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="Consequently when we see the moon way out there on the horizon, it seems like it must be bigger. High in the sky it should have grown closer but it didn't grow at all so it seems smaller."
      desc="I think some other factors also contribute, like comparison to distant objects and reduced contrast making minute details easier to see clearly. But I think this is the primary driver of our perception of size." >}}
