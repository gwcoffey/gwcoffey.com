I'm a little anti-social which might factor in to these. Please note: there's no judgement here. I'm not suggesting these things are unworthy of time. I have great respect for our culture. I just don't understand it sometimes or don't feel a compulsion to engage. I'm not sure why.

   {{< listapp/item title="I never know who anyone is when people are talking about people who are apparently somebody."
      desc="I always have to google names of apparently famous people. Half because I'm terrible with names and half because I'm out of the loop. I also got the Foo Fighters and the Goo Goo Dolls mixed up for a few days once because I was confused about Dave Grohl. It was a little embarrassing." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I've never seen a reality tv show."
      desc="I saw parts of an episode of Survivor once. My old business partner's girl friend used to watch some show where Gordon Ramsey revamps restaurants while yelling at the owners and it would be on in the background while I worked sometimes. And my daughter watches a show about elaborate cakes which I've seen parts of.  I don't like when people are mean to each other. So I struggle with these." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="The last Hip Hop/\"rap\" music I listened to was Public Enemy on the early 90s."

   {{< listapp/item title="I watched Super Bowl 20 and Super Bowl 40."
      desc="Plus three high school football games and one Indiana University football game. These make up the sum total of football I've seen in my life. I did watch a lot of college basketball in my teens. And I've been to a few baseball games and one pro basketball game." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I have not materially changed my style of clothing since high school."
      desc="Blue jeans. Brown leather shoes. Plaid short sleeve button up shirts. These are the things that will get you through." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I never watch R-rated comedies"
      desc="This one is judgmental: I always hate them. There are lots of good dramas and fantasies etc. But raunchy or juvenile comedy does exactly nothing for me. The last one I saw was Bridesmaids which I did not like much. Side note: I adore Kristin Wiig." >}}

   {{< listapp/item title="I have been to exactly one rock concert since 1994."
      desc="Went with my wife to U2 a few years ago. I have always said I don't really understand watching music. I get so bored." >}}
