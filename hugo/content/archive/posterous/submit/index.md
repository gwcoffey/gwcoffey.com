This is what you see when you *start* the process of filling out a passport application on the State Department web site.

So far as I know, the word "submit" only has two meanings. Since I haven't even started my application, I'm clearly not {{< q >}}presenting an application to a body for consideration.{{< /q >}} The only other meaning of "submit" is {{< q >}}to yield to a superior force{{< /q >}}, soâ€¦

Wait, never mind. It makes perfect sense.
