{{< poem/stanza
  "I have run out of ways to say I love you."
  "It happened yesterday."
  "My feelings have not changed."
  "My words have not changed."
  "But having been told—"
  "    a thousand times—"
  "    in a thousand subtly different ways—"
  "    have they lost their power?" 
>}}

{{< poem/stanza 
  "Yesterday morning you woke—"
  "    stretched—"
  "    and smiled—"
  "and I had no way to tell you"
  "just how much your waking meant to me."
