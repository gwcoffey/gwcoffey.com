This collection of sci-fi short stories by women authors is, unsurprisingly, a mixed bag, but also a lot of fun. It's arranged chronologically, starting with a 1928 story with *a twist* that is completely unsurprising, and ending with Ursula K Le Guin's 1969 classic novelette, *Nine Lives*.

I think the tastiest treat was C. L. Moore's surprising, creepy, imaginative and passionate *The Black God's Kiss* (1934). I won't spoil it with description, but I loved every page. It turns out it is the first of six stories around the same protagonist, all collected in a 1969 book also called *The Black God's Kiss*. You can be sure I added it to my list.
