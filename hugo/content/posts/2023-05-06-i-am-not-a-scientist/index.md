    "I have a theory"
    "That the universe"
    "   (the whole thing)"
    "As we know it"
    "Is just a little spontaneous turbulence"
    "In the dark energy"
    "   (or whatever)"
    "That flows laminar through the largerverse"
    "And pretty soon"
    "In a few hundred billion years"
    "It will settle back down"
    "To a gentle"
    "breeze"
    "of nothing."

Rome is not eternal; it does not matter. Rome will fall; it does not matter. The barbarian will conquer; it does not matter. There was a moment of Rome.
