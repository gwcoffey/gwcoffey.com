    "I have a theory"
    "that the universe"
    "   (the whole thing)"
    "as we know it"
    "is just a little spontaneous turbulence"
    "in the dark energy"
    "   (or whatever)"
    "that flows laminar through the largerverse"
    "and pretty soon"
    "in a few hundred billion years"
    "it will settle back down"
    "to a gentle"
    "breeze"
    "of nothing."

Rome is not eternal; it does not matter. Rome will fall; it does not matter. The barbarian will conquer; it does not matter. There was a moment of Rome.
