    "These are the trees I see where I stand"
    "The date palm which does not belong"
    "And the pecan which does not belong"
    "And the grapefruit, orange and lemon"
    "   â€” they do not belong"
    "And here is the olive"
    "   It feels like it belongs"
    "  But it does not"
    "And now we come to the mesquite"
    "   â€” It opens arms to all and says in a whisper you are welcome here"
    "And finally the paloverde anoints all in shining gold" >}}
