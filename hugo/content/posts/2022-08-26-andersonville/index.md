Kantor is an impeccable writer and this book is beautifully constructed. But it veers waaaaay too close to white southern apologia to be excusable in this the twenty-first century. I understand that Andersonville prison was a real place, and that the tragic events of the story are based in truth and worthy of examination. But Kantor's sympathetic characters seem wholly unaware of the centuries of suffering they themselves have perpetuated leading up to the events of the story, and Kantor doesn't seem to think it worth mentioning.

But other than that, how was the play Mrs. Lincoln? Because yes, if you ignore that glaring detail the book is very good.
