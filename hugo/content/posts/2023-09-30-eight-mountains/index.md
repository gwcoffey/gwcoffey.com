This was a recommendation from my father, who absolutely loved it. It's a beautifully written book about that friction between the world we sometimes imagine we want, and the world we really possess. It's about friendship, and about mountains. I can see why my father loved it. It's a contemplative book, well suited to reflection. I tihnk what I liked best was its *reverence*-- for nature, for the mountain, and for a pastoral world that no longer exists and perhaps in some sense never really did.
