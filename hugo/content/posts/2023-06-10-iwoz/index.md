This autobiography is co-authored by Gina Smith, and I wasn't sure what to expect. I'm sure Smith did major work to make this into a cohesive story. But she also left Wozniak's distinctive voice entirely intact. Every page reads like Wozniak talks, and if you've ever heard him interviewed you know what this means: childlike wonder and a total lack of pretension, shot through with delightful dorkiness. It makes *iWoz* a breeze and a joy to read.
