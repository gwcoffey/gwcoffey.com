{{< poem/stanza
    "The Grand Canyon is a place people like to go"
    "At least once in their lives"
    "Because it is a very deep crack in the world" >}}

{{< poem/stanza
    "It is not the deepest crack"
    "Not even close"  
    "There is one on the ocean floor"  
    "Fully eight times deeper" >}}

{{< poem/stanza
    "But the Grand Canyon is the deepest one"
    "That you can drive right up to"  
    "The deepest one with ample parking"  
    "Clear signage"  
    "And a range of tasteful dining options" >}}

{{< poem/stanza
    "So it is the place people go"
    "To see the trauma of the earth"  
    "Deep"  
    "Broken"  
    "And accessible" >}}
