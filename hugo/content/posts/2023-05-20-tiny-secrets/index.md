{{< poem/stanza
    "I like to be there when you wake."
    "Hello there, I say, and welcome you back."
    "You stretch your tiny arms,"
    "look side to side,"
    "—eyes wide—"
    "as you piece the world back together again"
    "with a mind that has not yet learned the word"
    "  jaded." >}}

   "What did you dream?" >}}

{{< poem/stanza
   "You share everything with me"
   "in your incommunicable baby way."
   "But not this."
   "  It is yours."
   "    You are mine."
   "      But not your tiny tiny secrets." >}}
