This book came so highly recommended from a friend that I suppose my expectations were out of whack. Didion is a wonderful writer, and there are some real gems in here. But a lot of this lacks currency in 2023, and so I was honestly a little underwhelmed. But I think that's a me-problem. In the right mindset I think it could do wonders.
