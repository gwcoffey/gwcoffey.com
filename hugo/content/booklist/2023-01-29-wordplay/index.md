Sometimes I get very bad puns stuck in my head. And sometimes, to debride my wounded mind, I draw them poorly.

<!--more-->

I use "draw" lightly here. I have a very unsteady hand and no sense of perspective. Typically I make a rough photo-collage of whatever I have in mind, then trace in [Procreate](https://procreate.com) with an Apple Pencil. Finally I remove the photos, and tidy/adjust as needed.
