I've only read a little Gibson, but I love his imaginative future-tech worlds. And I especially love his inventive use of language. I think my favorite example of this is the way the characters in this book use the word "funny". It has such a distinctive usage in this world, wich is so close to one way we would use it, but then not quite. It becomes a very believable micro-detail in this very-near-but-not-quite-current-future world. 

It also makes up for a weak-ish plot with great characterization. I really liked the kind, understated reluctant hero.
