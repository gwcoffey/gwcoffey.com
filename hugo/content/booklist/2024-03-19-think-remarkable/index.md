I've know Kawasaki for years, ever since I subscribed to an email newsletter he ran back when email newsletters felt futuristic. I've always kind of admired his folksy go-tiger motivational style. I heard him interviewed somewhere about this book and he said something interesting, I can't remember what exactly. But anyway all that led me to pick it up even though it is not the kind of book I'm normally drawn to.

All that to say, the only thing this book taught me is that I have no interest in being "remarkable."
