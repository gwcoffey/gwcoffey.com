This is a fun surprising compendium of mythological, folk, and religious monster figures throughout the Indian subcontinent. I'm not sure I'd recommend reading the whole thing from beginning to end. For me it is more fun to dip into and out of now and again for a little jolt of joy, which I've done off and on for several months.
