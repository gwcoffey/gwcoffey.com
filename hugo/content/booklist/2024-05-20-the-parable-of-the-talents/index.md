I immediately followed [*The Parable of the Sower*](/booklist/2024-05-03-the-parable-of-the-sower/) with this, its sequel and conclusion. This book is more cynical than *Sower*, perhaps in answer to criticism, or perhaps because it comes from the mind of an older author. 

It cuts between perspectives and timelines, sometimes from the protagonist of the first novel, and sometimes from her adult daughter many years later. This is a clever trick for an epistolary novel. The struggles of the mother carry more weight as we have information she does not, information about her own future.

Having finished the pair, it is obvious to me why these stories are on so many favorites lists. They are deeply though-provoking, deeply compassionate, and ultimately deeply hopeful. I really needed some of that right now.
