I've of course read this before. Like most people I read it in school. And then at least twice again since then. This time I listened to the audiobook. It was read beautifully by Selma Blair. 

I don't think I need to explain why this book is worth reading. Every human being should reat it more than once. Anne has such a clear, authentic voice, and her story is devastatingly sad in that it is so full of hope and promise cut short by something so crass as political hatred.

{{< quote >}}
When I write I can shake off all my cares. My sorrow disappears, my spirits are revived! But, and thatâ€™s a big question, will I ever be able to write something great, will I ever become a journalist or a writer?

I hope so, oh, I hope so very much, because writing allows me to record everything, all my thoughts, ideals and fantasies.

She got it but it isn't enough. Anne deserved so much more.
