date: 2023-12-15
summary: "I grew up in Indiana to mostly liberal parents in the heart of conservative America, and in the thick of the AIDS crisis. Which is to say Madonna was, for the most part, a *villain* in the cultural mind of my surroundings."

The book itself is straight forward, even a little boring in structure. It's a linear telling in six sections, essentially divided by decade. But this isn't a complaint. Madonna's story is so compelling that it doesn't need to be dressed up in a clever telling. Pro-tip: the ebook has an appendix of photographs that is not included with the audiobook. It's worth seeking them out.
