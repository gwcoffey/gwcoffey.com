This is my third or fourth reading of *The Road*. I picked it up to flip through and look up a couple of passages for a project I'm working on. A dangerous pastime I know. A few days later I had read it again. It's a short book, and a quick read. Some people find it too bleak to enjoy, but [to me it is the opposite](/2023-07-22-hope-in-hopelessness). It's a remarkable book.
