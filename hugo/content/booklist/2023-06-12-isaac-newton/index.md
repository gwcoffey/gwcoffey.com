This is more than a Biography (although it is a good one of those). It is an engrossing investigation into the state of and process of modern science in what was arguably its earliest days. This quote from John Maynard Keynes near the end of the book struck me:

{{< quote cite="John Maynard Keynes">}}
Newton was not the first of the age of reason, he was the last of the magicians, the last of the Babylonians and Sumerians, the last great mind which looked out on the visible and intellectual world with the same eyes as those who began to build our intellectual inheritance rather less than 10,000 years ago.

Gleick is a master of this kind of writing. *Isaac Newton* is unsurprisingly excellent.
