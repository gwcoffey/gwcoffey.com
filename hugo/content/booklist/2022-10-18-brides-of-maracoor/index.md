I love love love the original Wicked series, but I think I'm done with these sequels. Reminds me of an interview I read with some Disney executive after the Star Wars acquisition. He said something like "we see significant opportunity for value extraction in this property." Blech. "Art."

Anyway, the Maracoor books are not by any means bad. They just aren't special like the originals.

Rainary on the cover is beautiful though. So I'll consider that some value extracted.
