I adore this kind of book. It's a sort of renaissance work of affection and obsession. Lizzie Stark loves eggs in their manifold forms, and she decided to sit down and tell us why. I suppose you're wondering if this is a book about eggs-as-biology, or -as-food, or, perhaps, -as-symbol. And the answer to all three is: yes. It's fun, fast, surprisingly vulnerable, and genuinely interesting.

(I have to add that, frustratingly, the audiobook is marred by several production errors. Repeated lines, small skips, and mispronunciations. The book is wonderful none-the-less.)
