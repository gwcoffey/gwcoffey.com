*Augustus* is a perfectly written, surprisingly moving epistolary novel about the life of Caesar Augustus. Williams pulls off a magic trick here, telling an engrossing and compelling story of the first Emperor of Rome through personal drama. The world-altering historical events are a backdrop here. This is a book about the man and, to a lesser extent, his daughter.

The phrase "It does not matter" is a recurring motif. It reduces the *events* of the story to footnotes, and in the process the characters are elevated.

The despair that I have voiced seems to me now unworthy of what I have done. Rome is not eternal; it does not matter. Rome will fall; it does not matter. The barbarian will conquer; it does not matter. There was a moment of Rome.

Williams is a masterful writer. Each character writes with a distinctive voice, and you find youself *feeling* who is writing through voice alone. And the writing *style* is impeccable. I'm not versed enough it the world of Roman classics to identify this myself, but my daughter (who *is*) tells me Williams is using patterns here closely connected to Latin rhetorical style of the time.

Augustus has a core theme of inevitability: the inevitability of the Roman Empire itself, and its inevitable fall. And also of impermanence and perhaps even futility. These are surprising themes for a book about the *rise* of the empire.

Do they know that before us lies a road at the end of which is either death or greatness? The two words go around in my head, around and around, until it seems they are the same.

I love this book enough to immediately listen to the audiobook. And I'm sure I'll read it again.
