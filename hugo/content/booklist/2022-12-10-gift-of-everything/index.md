Poetry is just about the only kind of book I prefer to read in print (vs. ebook). When I scored a gift card to a local bookstore I used it to buy a few books of poetry. For the most part I chose at random. I had never heard of Lang Leav. But I liked the cover, and I liked the sweetness of a few poems I glanced through.

I read this book cover to cover. I won't say every poem is precisely *my thing*, but every poem is lovely, and there are many that strike my particular chord.
