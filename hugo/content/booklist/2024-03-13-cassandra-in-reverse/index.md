This book is a novel length, often funny, sometimes touching illustration of the [double empathy problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_empathy_problem). At times you'll find Cassandra annoying, but usually you'll just want to cheer for her as she comes to the inevitable realization. The story is occasionally too tidy, but it is charming enough that I didn't mind. And the mysterious-other-person subplot is genuinely moving and rewarding.
