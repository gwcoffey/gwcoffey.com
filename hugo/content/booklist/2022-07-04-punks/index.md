I heard John Keane interviewed about this book of poetry and ordered it right away. In the interview he read his remarkable poem *Beatitudes* which begins benignly: 

{{< quote >}}
Love Everything
{{< /quote >}}

And then proceeds to take this line seriously. It is a bold poem, and you will nod, scowl, and wonder. 

{{< quote >}}
Love the monster breeding inside you and slaughter him with love.<br>
Love the shipwreck of your body, your mind's salted garden.
{{< /quote >}}

Punks is large, powerful, and ambitious collectionâ€”the kind of book you can open to a random page, read, and be effected.
