Shūsaku Endō's masterpiece, *Silence*, is easily one of my favorite books of all time. As soon as I read it I wanted to read more, and finally got around to it. This book definitely didn't disappoint. As you would expect it is beautifully and thoughtfully written. (And the audiobook reading by David Holt is also wonderful.)

I wish modern Christianity had more in common with the version in the hearts of Endō's quiet and unassuming characters.
