My daughter's gilrfriend is reading this for the first time, and it got me amped up to re-read it myself. There's a special place in my heart reserved specifically for this book. For Gravesend, New Hampshire, and for John Wheelwright, for Hester and even John's stern grandmother, Harriet. And of course for the miracle of Owen himself.
