I was engrossed by the first act of *Stolen*, seen through the eyes of a nine-year-old girl. I loved the indigenous voices, bits of language and culture, and ominous plot. Things take a tragic turn, and Elsa quickly grows up. We then get a more straightforward story, part thriller, part crime novel. And all through we see an honest, complex indigenous community largely discarded by the people in power, and tormented by colonizers. It's a part of the world I was completely unaware of, and I enjoyed every page.
