I'm not sure why, but I remember this book having some kind of resurgence in my childhood. Perhaps it was just in my household. But I remember seeing it being read by both my parents and my uncle, and I remember lots of talk among them about it. I was way too young to read it myself, but more recently a friend recommended it. Updike is a nuanced and linguistically competent writer, and the plot is fast and engaging. As a character study it is engrossing.

It's hard in this modern era to look past the sometimes grating white-centerism of the book. Maybe that was intentionally thematic, but I can't help but think it runs deeper. In this book there are *Americans*, men and women, and then there are *Negroes* and *Chinamen* and so on. The obvious implication is that non-white Americans aren't real Americans, or at least require some kind of modifier. This doesn't have much to do with the book itself, but as I said it is grating to me now. And serves as a reminder that if I had read this book 15 years ago, I doubt I would have noticed at all.

I also came away thinking the book is so deeply rooted in 1960s America that it was hard to relate to. In some way's it's a time capsule into an America that hadn't yet been so deeply influenced *by books like this*. That makes it academically interesting but also subtracts from the ethos of the reading experience. I came away interested, intrigued, maybe even impressed. But not particularly moved. Is it a criticism that is lacks the timelessness of some of the "great" novels of the past? Probably not. At any rate I'm glad I read it and I think I probably will read the whole series.

*Postscript*: Perhaps I'm being overly negative here, but I'll pile on. What's up with the cover on the eBook edition (image above)? The publisher really phoned this one in which is a shame for a book of this calibre. It looks like someone squinted at the much more artful first edition cover below, sighed, said "That looks hardâ€¦" and fired up MS Paint and a clipart library. It really rubs me the wrong way when publishers treat their eBook releases like this.
