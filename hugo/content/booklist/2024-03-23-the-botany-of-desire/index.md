A friend recommended this to me. I read *The Omnivore's Dilemma* years ago and really enjoyed it. This book is also a nice read, in line with what I expect from Pollan: Light science and history, in a thoughtful and somewhat poetical context. I especially liked the section on the Apple, with its side eye at some classic American hagiography.

All in all a fun and interesting read.
