Kratzer posted to twitter about this labor of love. A self-published encyclopedia of such a wonderfully minutely massive subject. I'm such a sucker for this kind of thing. I mean Kratzer loves wasps! And it shows on every page! I can assure you there was lots here I did not, starting with "What is a 'social' wasp?" and, if I'm being honest, "What exactly is a *wasp* really?"

This book reminds me of the old web. Someone pouring their love, enthusiasm, and sweat into something very few people will read because the act of creating, organizing, and putting it out there is a compulsion. It sparks joy.

This is also a beautifully produced book and I'm so glad I found it.
