Dare I say it? This book is a little boring. I suppose Gibson's earned the right to just explore techno-future ideas without worrying too much about character and plot after giving us a lifetime of great stuff. As always, the tech is interesting and the language is fun. But overall not nearly as good as *The Peripheral*.
