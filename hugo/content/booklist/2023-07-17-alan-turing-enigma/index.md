Alan Turing was a remarkable and accomplished man who was cruelly used by society, and I appreciated learning more details about his life. That said, for my tastes this biogrophy is a little over-long and dry. When it finally did open up in the last chapter and began to have an opinion, I found it unconvincing. Still, a worthy read.
