When I read [this excerpt][ex] in *The Atlantic* I knew I had to read this book. It was wonderful. Part science, part philosophy, part love-letter to humanity. As an added bonus Green discusses several science fiction books I've never read and that went straight on my list. But what I liked best was that the author clearly loves this stuff, and it shows on every page.
