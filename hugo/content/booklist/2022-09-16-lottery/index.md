My daughter's girlfriend told me she read Shirley Jackson as a young teen, and Jackson instantly became her favorite author. I had never read any Jackson at all, so I bought this collection and read them all. Folks, I have questions. No, just kidding. These stories are superb. So very cynical. But superb. I am a little surprised a teenage girl would consider these her favorite stories. But that's a *good* surprise.
