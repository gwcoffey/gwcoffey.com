I grabbed this to listen to on a long drive with my wife. It's a moving story, with a steady plot. And it does a beautiful job of exploring the interior lives of several characters. Each one feels distinct and authentic, and you can identify with each in a different way. It really is masterful work on the part of the author.

It also has a striking and beautiful cover.
